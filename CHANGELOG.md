# Changelog

## [v0.23.5] - 2026-04-04

### Added

- **Gateway config**: Introduced `GatewayConfig` to bundle gateway model specs with AWS region, propagating it through the backend library so bedrock backends use the correct region.
- **Config coverage tests**: Integration tests that validate one model per Portkey config for each model type (LLM, image gen, extract, search), with `all_configs_gw` test profile and `make ticc` target.
- **nano-banana-2 model**: Added `gemini-3.1-flash-image-preview` as `nano-banana-2` with updated Google image gen costs.
- **DeepSeek models on bedrock**: Added DeepSeek models to the bedrock backend configuration.

### Changed

- **Image gen deck aliases**: Updated aliases to nano-banana model variants and removed `flux-2-pro`.
- **Remote config**: Bumped to v08.
- **Gateway model docs**: Regenerated, removing retired models (claude-3.7-sonnet, deepseek-v3.1, deepseek-v3.2-speciale, flux-2-pro).

### Fixed

- **deepseek-v3.1 structured output**: Removed unsupported `structured` output capability from the bedrock deepseek-v3.1 model spec — the `bedrock_aioboto3` worker does not implement object generation, so structured calls would fail at runtime.

## [v0.23.4] - 2026-04-02

### Changed

- **Pipe spec output alias**: Removed `output_type` alias from `parse_pipe_spec`, keeping only `output_concept` as the single alias for the `output` field. Simplified the alias resolution logic accordingly.

## [v0.23.3] - 2026-04-02

### Changed

- **Pipe spec output aliases**: `parse_pipe_spec` now accepts `output_concept` and `output_type` as aliases for the `output` field, with smart fallback when both alias and canonical field are present.

### Fixed

- **Gateway terms check**: Terms acceptance is now only required for inference operations, not for read-only operations like model spec fetching during validation.

## [v0.23.2] - 2026-03-30

### Changed

- **Claude Code plugin install command**: Fixed as → `/plugin install mthds@mthds-plugins` across README and docs.
- **Claude Code plugin reload instructions**: Added `/reload-plugins` as the primary method to activate the plugin, with exit/reopen as fallback.

## [v0.23.1] - 2026-03-30

### Changed

- **Concept spec: `concept_code` replaces `the_concept_code`** as the canonical field name in concept specs and working memory factory.
- **Shared spec parsing**: `concept_cmd` and `pipe_cmd` now delegate to the shared `parse_concept_spec` and `parse_pipe_spec` helpers, removing stale duplicate parsing logic while preserving compatibility and fixing alias/dict-mutation edge cases.
- **`concept_ref` / `pipe_ref` aliases**: `parse_concept_spec` and `parse_pipe_spec` now accept `concept_ref` and `pipe_ref` as input aliases for better AI-agent compatibility.
- **Replace `pip` with `uv`** in install commands across config files and error messages.
- **Docs links**: Updated mthds.ai links to include `/latest/` path.

### Fixed

- **Concept alias bug**: Concept alias handling previously listed `concept_code` as an alias instead of `the_concept_code`, causing valid input to be silently dropped. Fixed by the new shared `parse_concept_spec` helper.

## [v0.23.0] - 2026-03-29

### Added

- **Builder Operations module** (`pipelex/builder/operations/`): New standalone operation functions for the build agent — `concept_ops`, `inputs_ops`, `models_ops`, `output_ops`, `pipe_ops`, `runner_code_ops`, `validate_ops`. These decouple build logic from CLI commands so it can be reused by agents and the API.
- **`dry_run_pipeline`** (`pipelex/pipe_run/dry_run_pipeline.py`): New shared entrypoint to dry-run a pipeline from MTHDS contents and produce a `GraphSpec`. Used by both CLI graph commands and the API.

### Changed

- **`mthds_content` → `mthds_contents`**: Unified singular `mthds_content: str | None` into `mthds_contents: list[str] | None` across `PipelexRunner`, `pipeline_run_setup`, `validate_bundle`, CLI commands, and builder operations. Callers now pass a list of bundle content strings.
- **`bundle_uri` → `bundle_uris`**: Renamed `bundle_uri: str | None` to `bundle_uris: list[str] | None` across `PipelexRunner.__init__`, `pipeline_run_setup`, `dry_run_pipeline`, and all CLI call sites. Multiple bundles can now be loaded simultaneously.
- **Bump `mthds` dependency** to `>=0.2.0` (from `>=0.1.1`) to match the updated `RunnerProtocol` interface.
- **Graph rendering refactor**: Extracted dry-run logic from `graph_rendering._dry_run_bundle` into the new shared `dry_run_pipeline` function.
- **Agent CLI inputs**: Refactored `_inputs_core` to delegate to `builder.operations.inputs_ops.build_inputs_for_pipe` instead of duplicating bundle validation and input rendering logic.
- **Agent CLI run**: Added graph generation support with ReactFlow HTML output and side-effect metadata tracking in `_run_core`.
- **Deduplicate `models_cmd` → `models_ops`**: `models_cmd.py` is now a thin CLI wrapper delegating to `list_models()` and `format_models_markdown()` in `models_ops.py`, consistent with other agent CLI commands.

### Removed

- **`BuilderLoop`** and its iterative build-validate-fix cycle (`builder_loop.py`, `builder.py`, `builder_errors.py`). The build-agent CLI now drives spec construction directly.
- **`pipelex build pipe`** CLI command and associated MTHDS workflow files (`builder.mthds`, `agentic_builder.mthds`, `pipe_design.mthds`, `concept_fixer.mthds`, `synthesize_image.mthds`).
- **`pipelex-tools` runtime dependency**: Moved to dev-only dependency; `plxt` is now invoked via subprocess passthrough.

- **Talent system**: Removed talent enums, config mappings (`talent_preset_mappings`), and talent preset tests. Pipe specs accept model presets directly via the `model` field, making the talent indirection unnecessary.

### Fixed

- **Per-bundle dedup in pipeline run setup**: Fixed duplicate bundle loading when the same bundle appears in multiple sources.
- **HTTP utils**: Use HEAD-first strategy for URL validation to avoid downloading large payloads unnecessarily.
- **`library_dirs` passthrough**: Fixed `library_dirs` not being forwarded in builder operations (`inputs_ops`, `validate_ops`).
- **Dry-run status**: Fixed validation status reporting for dry-run results.


## [v0.22.0] - 2026-03-25

### Added

- **MiniMax Backend Support**: Added integration for MiniMax models (M2, M2.1, M2.5, M2.7 series including high-speed variants) with an `all_minimax` routing profile.
- **`check-model` Agent CLI Command**: Introduced `pipelex-agent check-model` to validate model references. Provides fuzzy matching suggestions, cross-collection suggestions, and wrong-sigil hints when an invalid model is provided.
- **Domain-Qualified Pipe References (`pipe_ref`)**: Added a `pipe_ref` property (`domain.code`) as the primary pipe index, allowing pipes with the same code to coexist across different domains. Bare code lookups remain supported as a fallback when unambiguous.
- **Duplicate Concept Detection**: Added validation to warn about duplicate concept declarations across different bundles within the same library.
- **Shared TOML Formatter**: Extracted a shared `format_toml_string` utility for consistent multi-line string formatting across the MTHDS factory and Agent CLI.

### Changed

- **Agent CLI Output Formats**: Overhauled `pipelex-agent` CLI output for LLM agents: `concept` and `pipe` commands now output raw TOML to stdout; `models` and `doctor` commands output Markdown by default (JSON still available via `--format json`).
- **Unified `model` Field in Pipe Specs**: Replaced type-specific talent fields (`llm_talent`, `extract_talent`, `img_gen_talent`, `search_talent`) with a single `model` field accepting model presets directly. Talent mappings removed from `pipelex-agent models` output accordingly.
- **Initialization Checks**: `check_is_initialized` now additionally verifies the presence of `plxt.toml`.
- **Documentation & Handoffs**: Updated Claude Code skills plugin docs, CLI references.

### Fixed

- **Domain Metadata Conflicts**: Loading multiple bundles declaring the same domain with differing descriptions or system prompts now emits a warning and keeps the first declaration instead of throwing an error.
- **Cross-Domain Execution Tracking**: Pipe controllers and the dry-run engine now track visited pipes using `pipe_ref` instead of bare codes, preventing false-positive loop detections when crossing domains.

### Removed

- **`assemble` Agent CLI Command**: Removed the `pipelex-agent assemble` command.

## [v0.21.0] - 2026-03-19

### Added

- **Web Page Extraction:** `PipeExtract` now supports extracting content from web pages via the new `linkup-fetch` model, with `render_js` and `include_raw_html` parameters. Added `@default-extract-web-page` alias to the extraction model deck.
- **New AI Models:** OpenAI / Azure: `gpt-5.4`, `gpt-5.4-pro`, `gpt-5.4-mini`, `gpt-5.4-nano`, `gpt-5.2-codex`; Mistral: `mistral-small-4`
- **DocumentContent Enhancements:** Added `public_url`, `filename`, `title`, and `snippet` fields to support web pages and search citations.
- **AI Agent Documentation:** Integrated `mkdocs-llmstxt-md` plugin to generate `/llms.txt` and `/llms-full.txt` for AI agents.
- **Claude Code Skills:** Added internal `.claude/skills` (`add-model`, `test-model`) for registering and testing new inference models.

### Changed

- **Web Fetching → Extract Domain:** Moved web fetching from the Search domain into the Extract domain. Replaced `FetchJob`, `FetchWorkerAbstract`, and related classes with native handling in `PipeExtract` and a new `GatewayExtractWorker`. Split `LinkupWorker` into dedicated `LinkupSearchWorker` and `LinkupExtractWorker`.
- **Search Results Unification:** `SearchResultContent` now uses `DocumentContent` instead of the removed `SearchSourceContent`.
- **Search Job Refactoring:** Encapsulated `SearchJob` parameters into a new `SearchJobParams` object; updated `SearchWorkerAbstract` signatures accordingly.
- **Documentation Build:** Replaced inline HTML generation with a `docs/root-index.html` template. Updated `robots.txt` to allow AI crawler access to `llms.txt`.

### Fixed

- **Remote Image Fetching:** Added error handling (`httpx.HTTPStatusError`, `httpx.RequestError`) in `GeneratedContentFactory` when downloading remote images, with graceful fallback to using the original URL as `public_url`.

### Removed

- **`page_image_captions` parameter:** Removed from `PipeExtractSpec` and `ExtractJobParams`.

## [v0.20.13] - 2026-03-16

### Removed

- Remove unused `ViewSpec` class and related code from graph/reactflow — dead code that was no longer referenced.

## [v0.20.12] - 2026-03-16

### Fixed

- Fix Google "Sitemap could not be read" error by adding `Allow: /sitemap.xml` to `ROOT_ROBOTS_TXT` — `Disallow: /` was blocking Googlebot from fetching the root sitemap even though `Sitemap:` pointed to it.

## [v0.20.11] - 2026-03-16

### Fixed

- Fix `docs-deploy-root` silently failing due to shell comments breaking the `\` continuation chain in the Makefile recipe — root `sitemap.xml` and updated `robots.txt` were never deployed in v0.20.10.

## [v0.20.10] - 2026-03-16

### Fixed

- Fix sitemap double-path bug (`latest/0.20.9/page/`) caused by `site_url` including `/latest/` while mike also inserts the version prefix during deployment.
- Override canonical URLs, `og:url`, and JSON-LD `url` to always point to `/latest/` via template override.
- Add root-level `sitemap.xml` generation with `/latest/` URLs to `docs-deploy-root`.

## [v0.20.9] - 2026-03-16

### Changed

- Reorganize documentation site architecture and navigation.
- Add SEO meta descriptions to all doc pages.
- Redesign README: lead with value, collapse details.

## [v0.20.8] - 2026-03-13

- Add `needs_model_specs=True` to agent CLI run and models commands.

## [v0.20.7] - 2026-03-12

- Bump `mthds` dependency to `>=0.1.1`.

## [v0.20.6] - 2026-03-12

### Added

- **`needs_model_specs` parameter**: New option on `Pipelex.make()` and CLI factories to load real gateway model specs without enabling full inference. Validation commands (`pipelex validate`, `pipelex-agent validate`) now fetch live model specs, improving accuracy of pipe/method/bundle validation.

### Removed

- **Deprecated `pipelex_inference` backend**: Removed all traces of the legacy backend — config files, enum values, migration logic, deprecation warnings, and documentation admonitions. The transition to `pipelex_gateway` is complete.

### Fixed

- **`pipelex init inference --local`**: Fixed file filter to also copy `.md` files (e.g. Gateway model lists) to the backends directory, not just `.toml` files.
- **Gateway terms persistence**: Hardened failure handling — when terms acceptance can't be persisted (e.g. unwritable global directory), gateway is now properly disabled in `backends.toml` as a fallback, preventing `GatewayTermsNotAcceptedError` at runtime.

## [v0.20.5] - 2026-03-09

### Changed

- **Config paths use `pathlib.Path`**: All `ConfigLoader` properties and methods now return `Path` instead of `str`. Consumer code across the config system (doctor, init, backends, routing, credentials, telemetry, agent CLI) updated accordingly.
- **Layered config resolution for `pipelex doctor` and `pipelex init`**: Config files are now resolved with project-first, global-fallback layering per file. Fixed `replace_backend_file` using CWD-relative path that broke when run from another directory.
- **Gateway terms are explicitly global**: `update_service_terms_acceptance` now targets `~/.pipelex/` by default, since gateway terms are a user-level agreement, not project-level.
- Tweaks to the `pipelex-agent` CLI to play well with the Claude Code plugin and skills.

## [v0.20.4] - 2026-03-04

- Improve README.md instructions for Claude Code and MTHDS skills.

## [v0.20.3] - 2026-03-04

### Fixed

- Rewrote README with updated CV Batch Screening example, corrected CLI command, inputs schema, Python snippet, and pipe descriptions.

## [v0.20.2] - 2026-03-04

### Fixed

- Fixed removal of the --reset flag from the init command docs.
- Fixed the name of the `PipeSequence` results within a batch.

## [v0.20.1] - 2026-03-03

### Changed

- **Cost Report Consistency**: Renamed `platform_llm_id` field to `platform_model_id` in `LLMTokenCostReport`, aligning with all other report types (ImgGen, Extract, Search, Fetch) that already use `platform_model_id`.
- **Test Coverage**: Added `linkup` backend to the coverage test profile.

## [v0.20.0] - 2026-03-03

### Added

- **CLI Authentication**: `pipelex login` command that initiates a browser-based OAuth flow (GitHub/Google) to authenticate with the Pipelex Gateway and save the API key locally.
- **Search Filtering**: `from_date`, `to_date`, `include_domains`, and `exclude_domains` options on the `PipeSearch` operator, routed through a new `GatewaySearchWorker`.
- **Expanded Cost Reporting**: Token usage and cost tracking now covers Search, Fetch, Extraction, and Image Generation jobs, in addition to LLMs.
- **New Models**: Added `gpt-5.3-codex` (text, images, pdf inputs) and `nano-banana-2`.

### Changed

- **Search Configuration**: Renamed Linkup model IDs from `linkup/standard` to `linkup-standard` (and `deep` variant), simplified presets to `$standard` and `$deep`.
- **Default Pipeline Execution**: Changed from `in_memory` to `local`.
- **Default Extraction Model**: Changed from `mistral-document-ai-2505` to `azure-document-intelligence`; removed `mistral-document-ai-2505` from the supported Gateway models list.
- **Content Handling**: `TextAndImagesContent` now supports an optional `raw_html` field.
- **Dev Experience**: `Makefile` commands (`generate-mthds-schema`, `update-gateway-models`) run in quiet mode by default.

## [v0.19.0] - 2026-03-02

### Added
 - **Web Search Integration**: Introduced a new `PipeSearch` operator, native support for Linkup as a search backend provider, `SearchResult` and `SearchResultContent` concepts for handling answers with citations, and Model Deck support for search models.
 - **Graph View Generation**: Added a `--view` option to `pipelex validate bundle` that generates a `ViewSpec` JSON (compatible with ReactFlow) for client-side graph rendering without writing files to disk.

### Changed
 - **Test Configuration**: Added a `search` pytest marker, excluded from default test runs.
 - `mthds` bumped to `>=0.1.0`.
 - `pipelex-tools` bumped to `>=0.2.3`.
 - `linkup-sdk>=0.12.0` added as optional dependency for the Linkup search provider.

## [v0.18.6] - 2026-03-01

### Added

- **GitHub URL support for CLI method targets** — All CLI commands accepting a method target (`pipelex validate method`, `pipelex run method`, `pipelex build inputs method`, etc.) now accept a public GitHub URL (e.g., `https://github.com/org/repo/tree/main/methods/my-method`). The repository is cloned automatically, and the method package is discovered and validated. Subdirectory URLs are supported.
- **Local path support for CLI method targets** — Method targets can now also be local filesystem paths pointing to a directory containing a `METHODS.toml`. This works for both `pipelex` and `pipelex-agent` CLIs.
- Added `clone_default_branch()` in `mthds` package for shallow-cloning a git repository's default branch.

## [v0.18.5] - 2026-03-01

### Changed

- `pipelex-agent assemble` command now outputs JSON to stdout by default.

## [v0.18.4] - 2026-03-01

### Added

- Introduced a **lenient loading mode** for `InferenceBackendLibrary` and `RoutingProfileLoader`: when enabled, logs warnings instead of raising errors for missing credentials, variable fallback failures, or disabled backends — skipping individual backends gracefully rather than crashing the entire load process.
- Added `needs_inference` parameter to `Pipelex.make`, `make_pipelex_for_cli`, and `make_pipelex_for_agent_cli` to control whether full inference setup (credentials, gateway checks, telemetry) is required.
- Added `needs_inference_in_pipelex` helper to `shared_pytest_plugins` to replace the inverted logic of the previous helper.

### Changed

- **CLI Robustness:** `pipelex build`, `validate`, `show`, `graph`, `inputs`, and `which` commands now run with `needs_inference=False`, allowing them to succeed even when backend credentials are missing or incomplete.
- Refactored `Pipelex.make`: renamed `disable_inference` to `needs_inference` (default `True`). When `False`, enables lenient backend loading, uses a dummy remote config, disables telemetry, and skips `validate_model_deck()`.

### Deprecated

- `is_inference_disabled_in_pipelex` in `shared_pytest_plugins` — migrate to `needs_inference_in_pipelex`.

## [v0.18.3] - 2026-02-27

- Updated `pipelex-tools` dependency to `0.2.1`

## [v0.18.2] - 2026-02-27

### Added

- **Inputs path resolution** — Relative file paths (e.g., `"url": "data/invoice.pdf"`) inside `inputs.json` are now resolved relative to the inputs file's parent directory, making bundle directories self-contained and portable. Applies to both user and agent CLIs. Handles HTTP, data:, pipelex-storage://, and absolute paths by leaving them unchanged.

### Changed

- **`pipelex-agent init` defaults to local project** — The `init` command now targets the project-level `.pipelex/` directory by default (at detected project root) instead of auto-detecting. The `--local` flag has been removed. Use `--global`/`-g` to target `~/.pipelex/`. Errors out if no project root is found without `-g`.
- **`pipelex-agent doctor` supports `--global`/`-g`** — The `doctor` command now accepts `--global`/`-g` to check the global `~/.pipelex/` directory. Without the flag, it auto-detects project `.pipelex/` if present, else falls back to `~/.pipelex/`.
- **`pipelex-agent init --config` improved help** — The `--config` option help text now shows the JSON schema with field types upfront for better discoverability.

### Fixed

- **`pipelex-agent init -g` service agreement** — The `--global` flag now correctly writes the gateway service terms acceptance (`pipelex_service.toml`) to the target directory instead of always writing to the auto-detected config dir.
- **Deterministic file discovery order** — `find_files_in_dir` now sorts `rglob`/`glob` results for consistent ordering across platforms and Python versions. On Linux with Python < 3.13, `rglob` returned filesystem-order results, which could cause `test_validate_all` to fail by picking up a test package's `METHODS.toml` before pipelex internal bundles.

## [v0.18.1] - 2026-02-25

### Fixed

- Fix docs deployment failure caused by shell metacharacters (parentheses) in Makefile `PRINT_TITLE` macro argument for `docs-deploy-root` target
- Fix `mike` unable to find `mkdocs` binary by adding venv `bin/` to PATH in all mike-based Makefile targets

## [v0.18.0] - 2026-02-25

**Highlights:**

- **Pipelex Gateway** — The deprecated `pipelex_inference` backend is now replaced by `pipelex_gateway`, featuring remote model configuration fetching so you always have access to the latest models without updating Pipelex.

    **Getting your API key:**

    1. Get your API key at [app.pipelex.com](https://app.pipelex.com/)
    2. Add it to your `.env` file: `PIPELEX_GATEWAY_API_KEY=your-key-here`

    **Gateway Supported models — included with the Free API Key**

    - **Language Models (LLM):**
        - OpenAI: all models up to GPT-5.2 and Codex
        - Anthropic: Claude 3.7 Sonnet through Claude 4.5 Haiku/Sonnet/Opus
        - Google: Gemini 2.0/2.5 Flash, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Gemini 3.0 Flash/Pro
        - xAI: Grok 3/mini, Grok 4 (+ fast reasoning variants)
        - Open-source: Mistral Large 3, DeepSeek v3.1/3.2/Speciale, GPT-OSS 20B/120B1, Kimi K2, Phi-4, Qwen3-VL 235B
    - **Document Extraction:** Mistral Document AI, Azure Document Intelligence, DeepSeek OCR
    - **Image Generation:** GPT-Image 1/1.5, Flux 2 Pro, Nano Banana/Pro

    **Accepting the Terms of Service:**

    When you run `pipelex init`, you'll be prompted to accept the Gateway terms of service. By using Pipelex Gateway, telemetry is automatically enabled and identified by your API key (hashed for security) to monitor service quality and enforce fair usage. **We only collect technical data** (model names, token counts, latency, error rates)—never your prompts, completions, or business data. See our [Privacy Policy](https://go.pipelex.com/privacy-policy).

    **⚠️ Migration deadline:** If you were using `pipelex_inference`, please migrate soon—the legacy service will be shut down within few days. Get your new Gateway key at [app.pipelex.com](https://app.pipelex.com/).

- **Execution Graph Visualization System** (preview feature) — Comprehensive tracing and visualization for pipeline executions.

    **CLI:** `--graph` flag on `pipelex run` generates execution graphs. New `pipelex graph render <graph.json>` command for post-run rendering.

    **Viewers:** Interactive ReactFlow viewer (`reactflow.html`) with pan/zoom and node inspector. Mermaid diagrams (`mermaidflow.html`) with subgraphs and clickable nodes.

    **Makefile:** `make view-graph` (`vg`) and `make serve-graph` (`sg`) to start a local graph viewer.

- **Pydantic Structure Generation** — Two new CLI commands bridge Pipelex's declarative concepts with your Python code:

    **`pipelex build structures /library_dir/`** — Generates Pydantic models from all concept definitions found in the specified library directory. Now you have your structures as Python code: you can iterate on them, add custom validation functions, or use them as type hints in your code.

    **`pipelex build runner`** — Now automatically generates both the Python runner file AND the required Pydantic structures. When you run this command, it creates a complete, ready-to-execute Python script that imports the generated structures, so you can immediately use typed objects in your pipeline code.

    See the [Build Commands documentation](https://docs.pipelex.com/latest/tools/cli/build/) for usage examples.

- **New Backends & Models**:
    - **Hugging Face Inference** — Support for Hugging Face Inference API, including `qwen-image` text-to-image model.
    - Google `gemini-3.0-flash-preview`
    - Mistral OCR latest model `mistral-ocr-2512`
    - **Scaleway** inference provider support for open-source models
    - **Portkey AI** backend integration for unified access to multiple models through a single API key

- **Document Support in `PipeLLM`** — Include `Document` objects (like PDFs) directly in prompts using `@variable` or `$variable` syntax. Supports single documents, multiple documents, and lists, combinable with text and image inputs.

- **`PipeCompose` Construct Mode** — New mode for deterministically building `StructuredContent` objects without an LLM. Compose fields from working memory variables, fixed values, templates, and nested structures.

- **Content Storage System** — Configurable storage for generated artifacts (images, extracted pages). Supports `local` filesystem (`.pipelex/storage/`), `in_memory`, **AWS S3** (`pip install pipelex[s3]`), and **Google Cloud Storage** (`pip install pipelex[gcp-storage]`). Cloud providers support both public URLs and time-limited signed URLs. Content referenced via stable `pipelex-storage://` URIs.

- **Langfuse & OpenTelemetry Observability** — New OpenTelemetry-based observability system enables powerful tracing and Evals through Langfuse integration. Also supports OTLP-compatible backends (Datadog, Honeycomb, etc.). Configured via `.pipelex/telemetry.toml`.

- **Python 3.14 Support** — Officially tested and supported.

- **Agent CLI (`pipelex-agent`)**: New machine-first CLI for AI agents with structured JSON output for all commands (`build`, `run`, `validate`, `inputs`, `concept`, `pipe`, `assemble`, `graph`, `models`, `doctor`).
- **LLM Reasoning Controls**: Unified support for "Thinking" models (Chain of Thought) with `reasoning_effort`, `reasoning_budget`, and `thinking_mode` parameters. Supports Anthropic Extended Thinking, Google Gemini Thinking, OpenAI Reasoning (`o1`/`o3`), and Mistral/Magistral models. Includes new presets: `$deep-analysis` and `$quick-reasoning`.
- **Image-to-Image Generation**: `PipeImgGen` now supports input images via `input_images` field, with `InputImagesTaxonomy` for provider-specific handling and variable reference detection (`{{ var }}`, `$var`, `@var`) in prompts.
- **PipeCompose "Construct" Mode**: New `construct` mode for building structured objects (dictionaries/Pydantic models) directly from variables.
- **Nested concepts in inline structures**: You can now define nested structures for your concepts in your `.plx` files. Learn more here: [Nested Concepts in Inline Structures](https://docs.pipelex.com/latest/building-methods/concepts/inline-structures).

### Breaking Changes

- **CLI restructure: `method` / `pipe` subcommands** — `pipelex run`, `pipelex validate`, and all `pipelex build` subcommands (`runner`, `inputs`, `output`) now require an explicit `method` or `pipe` keyword. For example: `pipelex run method my-method` or `pipelex run pipe scoring.compute`. The old `pipelex run <target>` form is no longer supported. The agent CLI (`pipelex-agent`) follows the same structure.

### Added

- **Method resolution (`cli/method_resolver.py`)** — resolves installed method names to pipe codes and library directories. Integrates with `mthds` discovery module to find methods in `~/.mthds/methods/` and `./.mthds/methods/`.
- **`run method` command** — run an installed method by name, optionally overriding the pipe with `--pipe`.
- **`validate method` command** — validate all bundles in an installed method.
- **`build runner/inputs/output method` commands** — generate build artifacts for installed methods.
- **Persistent Credential Storage (`~/.pipelex/.env`)**: `pipelex init` now prompts for missing API keys after backend selection and saves them to `~/.pipelex/.env` with `0600` permissions. Credentials are loaded automatically at startup (global defaults, overridden by project `.env`).
- **`pipelex init credentials` Command**: New standalone focus to re-enter API keys without resetting configuration. Scans enabled backends, detects missing env vars, and prompts only for those.
- **Package Management System:** Introduced a full package manager for MTHDS with `METHODS.toml` manifests, `methods.lock` lockfile generation, local path and remote Git-based dependency resolution (MVS), a local package cache (`~/.mthds/packages`), and a new `pipelex pkg` CLI command group (`init`, `list`, `add`, `lock`, `install`, `update`, `publish`, `search`, `inspect`, `graph`).
- **Hierarchical Domains:** Support for dot-separated domain namespaces (e.g., `legal.contracts.shareholder`) and cross-package references via `alias->domain.pipe` syntax.
- **PipelexRunner:** Introduced the `PipelexRunner` class as the primary entry point for executing pipelines, replacing `PipelexClient` and standalone `execute_pipeline`/`start_pipeline` functions.
- **Linting & Formatting:** Integrated `plxt` (Pipelex Tools) for formatting and linting `.mthds` and `.toml` files, including CI/CD checks alongside `ruff`.
- **JSON Schema:** Automatic generation of `mthds_schema.json` for standard definition, IDE validation, and auto-completion.
- **Dev CLI:** Added `pipelex-dev` CLI for internal development tasks (e.g., schema generation).
- **CSP Nonce Support:** Added Content Security Policy nonce support for generated HTML graphs (Mermaid/ReactFlow) to enable secure rendering in VS Code webviews.
- **OpenRouter Backend:** Added OpenRouter as an inference backend with 337 chat model definitions and 14 image generation models.
- **Builder Auto-Repair**: Self-healing capabilities including auto-generation of undeclared concepts, multiplicity mismatch fixes, and pruning of unreachable pipes/unused concepts.
- **Concept Field Features**: Added `choices` support (compiles to `Literal` types/Enums) and explicit `list` type with `item_type`/`item_concept_ref`.
- **PipeFunc Execution Error Context**: When a `@pipe_func` function fails during execution, the error message now includes detailed context: the function name, actual input values from working memory, expected output type, and the original error with its type. This makes debugging PipeFunc errors much easier.
- **`pipelex build output` CLI Command**: New command to generate example output JSON for a pipe, complementing the existing `pipelex build inputs` command. Shows the expected output structure based on the pipe's output concept type, with multiplicity support. For pipes with `native.Anything` output (e.g., `PipeCondition` with different mapped pipe outputs), displays all possible outputs from mapped pipes.
- **Telemetry System**: Introduced anonymous usage tracking and exception capture for CLI commands (`graph render`), reporting to both user-configured and Pipelex analytics endpoints.
- **PipeExtract Operator Validation**: Added strict input validation that raises configuration errors for incompatible input types or when document-specific parameters are used with image inputs.
- **PipeCondition Output Auto-Fix in Builder Loop**: The pipe builder now automatically fixes `PipeCondition` output concept errors during validation. If all mapped pipes have the same output, the `PipeCondition` output is set to that concept; otherwise it's set to `native.Anything`.
- **PipeFunc Return Type Validation**: Added validation to ensure that a `PipeFunc` function's return type matches the output concept's structure class.
- **URL Validation on `ImageContent` and `DocumentContent`**: Both models validate external resources (HTTP/HTTPS URLs via HEAD request, local file paths via existence check) through a `validate_resources()` method called during pipeline execution (`validate_before_run`) rather than at model instantiation. Internal URIs (`data:`, `pipelex-storage://`) skip validation entirely. Validation is skipped in dry-run mode where inputs use mock URLs.
- **Literal Type Support in Dry Run Mocks**: `DryRunFactory` now detects `Literal` type annotations (including `Optional[Literal[...]]`) and generates valid mock values by randomly picking from the allowed choices instead of producing invalid random strings.
- **Literal Type Support in `pipelex build inputs`/`pipelex build output`**: The concept representation generator now handles `Literal` fields by picking a random value from the allowed choices, and generates mock URL patterns for `url` fields.
- **Literal Error Handling in Validation Messages**: Pydantic validation error formatting now recognizes `literal_error` types and displays them as "Invalid choice errors" with the actual value and expected options.
- **`PipeRunError` Catching in Bundle Validation**: `validate_bundle` now catches `PipeRunError` during dry run and wraps it in `ValidateBundleError` with a clear message.
- **`ValidationError` Catching in Pipeline Execution**: `execute_pipeline` now catches Pydantic `ValidationError` from input construction, formats the errors, and raises a `PipeExecutionError` with a clear message.
- **Broader Error Handling in CLI `pipelex run`**: The CLI run command now catches `PipelexError` in addition to `PipelineExecutionError`, providing better error messages for failures that occur outside the pipeline execution itself.
- **Content Filenames:** Added `filename` field to `ImageContent` and `DocumentContent`, with auto-population from local file paths via new `extract_filename_from_uri` helper.
- **Batch Validation Error Type:** Introduced `PipeValidationErrorType.BATCH_ITEM_NAME_COLLISION` for naming conflicts in batch operations.
- **Documentation:** Added naming convention rules to `builder.plx` and `pipe_design.plx` (batch input lists should be plural, item names singular).
- **`--library-dir` CLI Option**: `--library-dir` / `-L` option for `pipelex run`, `pipelex validate`, and `pipelex build` subcommands (`one-shot-pipe`, `partial-pipe`) to specify additional directories for searching pipe definitions. Can be specified multiple times.
- **Automatic File Loading**: The core pipeline execution functions (`pipelex.execute_pipeline`, `pipelex.start_pipeline`) can now directly load a pipeline from a file path via a new `bundle_uri` parameter.
- **Dry Run Mode**: `pipelex run --dry-run` executes pipeline logic without API calls, useful for validating structure and generating orchestration graphs. Combine with `--mock-inputs` to generate mock data for missing required inputs.
- **`| with_images` Jinja2 Filter**: Explicitly extract and include all nested images from complex data structures (e.g., `Page` objects or custom concepts with `Image` fields). Renders the object's text representation while making associated images available to the LLM.
- **System Prompt Media Support**: Reference images and documents in `system_prompt` using the same `$variable` and `@variable` syntax as the user `prompt`.
- **Pipelex Gateway Service**: Terms of service management via `.pipelex/pipelex_service.toml` and interactive acceptance flow in `pipelex init` and `pipelex init agreement`.
- **Gateway Available Models Documentation**: Auto-generated reference of all LLM, Document Extraction, and Image Generation models available through the Gateway.
- **Configurable Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff for inference API calls, configurable in `pipelex.toml` under `[cogt.tenacity_config]`
- **Context Manager Support**: The `Pipelex` class now supports `with Pipelex.make(): ...` for graceful shutdown
- **Validation Improvements**:
    - Pipelex Bundle concept keys: prevent bundles from re-creating a native concept
    - `PipeSequence`: output multiplicity must match the last step's output multiplicity
    - `PipeFunc`: output multiplicity must match the function return type (`ListContent` subclass for multiplicity=true)
- **Rendering Protocols**: Three new `@runtime_checkable` protocols (`ImageRenderable`, `TagRenderable`, `TextFormatRenderable`) to formalize the interaction between data types and Jinja2 filters.
- **Unified URI Handling System**: New `pipelex.tools.uri` module providing type-safe parsing for HTTP/HTTPS URLs, local file paths, file URIs, `pipelex-storage://` URIs, and base64 data URLs.
- **Automatic Input Data Storage**: Pipeline pre-processing step that converts large `data:` URLs in an `ImageContent` or `DocumentContent` into `pipelex-storage://` URIs for improved performance, by storing the data with the configured storage provider. Configurable via `is_normalize_data_urls_to_storage` in `pipelex.toml`.
- **`pipelex build inputs` Command**: New CLI command to generate example input JSON files for pipes. Supports `--library-dir` (`-L`) to specify library directories.
- **Pipe Code Syntax Validation**: Bundle validation now checks that pipe codes and `main_pipe` values use valid snake_case syntax, with proper error categorization (`INVALID_PIPE_CODE_SYNTAX`).

### Changed

- **CI Runner Optimization**: Split self-hosted runners into dedicated test (D32) and lint (D4) pools with pre-baked Docker image (Python 3.10-3.14, UV, dependency cache) for faster job startup.
- **MTHDS Light Client Extraction**: The light client protocol (runner, pipeline models, pipe output abstractions) has been extracted from pipelex into the new [`mthds`](https://github.com/mthds-ai/mthds-python) package on PyPI. Pipelex now depends on `mthds>=0.0.1` and implements its `RunnerProtocol`.
- **Global/Local Config Split**: `pipelex init` now creates configuration in `~/.pipelex/` (global) by default. Use `pipelex init --local` to create project-level overrides in `{project_root}/.pipelex/`. Config loading merges: package defaults → global → project → overrides.
- **IDE Extension Detection**: Extension check now uses `code --list-extensions` / `cursor --list-extensions` for reliable detection instead of folder scanning. Shows separate marketplace links for VS Code (Microsoft Marketplace) and Cursor (Open VSX Registry).
- **Quieter `pipelex init`**: Removed verbose file listing and reset messages from config initialization output.
- **`pipelex init` Help Text**: Detailed focus option descriptions now shown in `pipelex init --help` explaining each focus (`all`, `config`, `credentials`, `inference`, `routing`, `telemetry`, `agreement`).
- **File Extension:** Pipeline definitions now use `.mthds` instead of `.plx`; the project refers to "Methods" (MTHDS) rather than "Pipelex workflows".
- **Syntax:** In `PipeParallel` definitions, `parallels` field renamed to `branches`; `plx_config` in `pipelex.toml` renamed to `mthds_config`.
- **Documentation:** Comprehensive update to reflect `.mthds` file format, package management, and new project structure.
- **Model Deck Updates**: Default premium model now `claude-4.6-opus`; added Mistral models (`mistral-small-3.2`, `mistral-large`, `magistral` series) and `gpt-5` placeholders.
- **Jinja2 Rendering**: Image objects now replaced with placeholders (e.g., `[Image 1]`) during text generation; async filters only registered in async environments.
- **Backend Configurations**: Added `effort_to_level_map` and `effort_to_budget_maps` for reasoning translation; disabled Google Vertex AI by default.
- **Dependencies**: Updated `pypdfium2`, `anthropic`, and `mistralai` version constraints.
- **`pipelex run --dry-run`**: No longer pretty prints the main_stuff output, matching the expected behavior for dry runs where no actual inference occurs.
- **`pipelex build structures` Command**: Now uses a lightweight loading mechanism that only processes domains and concepts, skipping pipe loading and validation entirely. This fixes the chicken-and-egg problem where structure generation would fail due to pipe validation errors before the structures were even created. Added `--force` / `-f` flag to regenerate all structures without checking if classes already exist.
- **Test Profile System**: Refactored integration tests to use a new configuration system (`.pipelex/test_profiles.toml`) with `dev`, `ci`, and `full` profiles for controlling which AI models are used in parametrized tests, replacing runtime filtering and hardcoded model lists.
- **`pipelex run --graph` Flag**: Now acts as an override for `pipelex.toml` settings instead of defaulting to `true`.
- **Default Image Generation Models**: Updated in `base_deck.toml`: `base-img-gen`: `flux-2-pro`, `best-img-gen`: `nano-banana-pro`, `fast-img-gen`: `gpt-image-1-mini`
- **Remote Configuration**: Updated service URL to version 3.
- **GatewayExtractWorker**: Now checks model capabilities before attempting image captioning.
- Change the output validation of `PipeCondition`: If all mapped pipes have the same output concept, `PipeCondition`'s output MUST be that same concept. If mapped pipes have different output concepts, `PipeCondition`'s output MUST be the native concept `Anything`.
- **CLI**: Changed `pipelex validate all` to `pipelex validate --all` (or `-a`).
- **StructuredContent.rendered_html()**: Now recursively calls `rendered_html()` on nested `StuffContent` fields instead of using json2html conversion. Also skips `None` values and uses HTML table format.
- **Batch Pipe Validation:** Enforced stricter naming rules for batch specs—`input_item_name` must differ from `input_list_name` and not shadow existing input keys, with clearer error messages suggesting plural/singular conventions.
- **Jinja2 Integration Refactored to Protocol-Based Approach**: Replaced the `Jinja2Registry` singleton and handler functions with a decoupled protocol-based system, eliminating circular dependencies between the template layer and core domain logic.
- **`StuffArtefact` Redesigned as Delegation Adapter**: Now a lightweight, immutable adapter that delegates attribute access directly to underlying `Stuff` and `StuffContent` objects, improving performance and providing more intuitive field access.
- **Image Extraction Moved to Content Types**: `StructuredContent`, `ListContent`, `ImageContent`, and `TextAndImagesContent` now implement the `ImageRenderable` protocol, replacing centralized handler logic.
- **⚠️ Breaking**: User override config renamed from `pipelex_super.toml` to `pipelex_override.toml`.
- **Image Generation Architecture**: Refactored to taxonomy-based approach. Standardizes parameter translation (`aspect_ratio`, `quality`, `output_format`) to provider-specific APIs.
- **Document Extraction Improvements**: `pypdfium2` extractor now extracts embedded images from PDFs. Response parsing uses dedicated Pydantic schemas for validation.
- **Default Model Change**: `extract_text_from_visuals` deck now defaults to `azure-document-intelligence`
- **`pipelex_inference` replaced by `pipelex_gateway`**: See Highlights for migration details. New `PIPELEX_GATEWAY_API_KEY` environment variable; default routing profiles updated to `pipelex_gateway_first`.
- **Telemetry System Split**: Now two separate streams:
    1. Pipelex Gateway telemetry for service monitoring (never collects prompts/completions/business data)
    2. Custom telemetry to user-configured backends
    3. Config updated accordingly (`telemetry.toml`):
      - Renamed `[posthog]` to `[custom_posthog]` to distinguish user's PostHog from Pipelex Gateway telemetry
      - Added new `[custom_portkey]` section with `force_debug_enabled` and `force_tracing_enabled` settings
- **Main Configuration Overrides Updated** (`.pipelex/pipelex.toml`):
    - `pipelex_override.toml` (final override) renamed from `pipelex_super.toml` to `pipelex_override.toml` and moved from repo root to `.pipelex/` directory
    - `telemetry_override.toml` (personal telemetry settings)
    - `is_generate_cost_report_file_enabled` default changed from `true` to `false`

- **Documentation**:
  - Clarified **Setup (first run)** vs **Configuration (TOML reference)**, added a Setup overview page, and added contributor docs for configuration defaults/overrides.
  - Added the "Under the Hood" page documenting the execution graph tracing system.
- **`pipelex init`**: Now creates a documented `telemetry.toml` template instead of prompting for preferences
- **Model Catalog Updated**: Latest models (gpt-5.1, claude-4.5-opus, gemini-3.0-pro, etc.) and updated waterfalls in `base_deck.toml`
- **Model Constraints Refactored**: From simple lists to structured `valued_constraints` dictionaries (e.g., `valued_constraints = { fixed_temperature = 1 }`)
- **OpenAI Responses API**: New implementation now differentiates between `openai_completions` and `openai_responses`
- **CLI Initialization**: Commands refactored to use centralized `Pipelex` initialization factory for improved error handling
- **`pipelex doctor`**: Enhanced to detect outdated `telemetry.toml` formats and suggest fixes
- **`--output-dir` Option**: The `runner`, `structures`, and `inputs` CLI commands now accept this option
- **Cost Report**: Now displays a note clarifying that it only includes LLM costs
- **`description` Field Now Required**: In `PipeAbstract`, `PipeBlueprint`, and `PipeSpec` classes.
- **Configuration**: New `[pipelex.pipeline_execution_config.graph_config]` section in `pipelex.toml` for fine-grained control over graph generation, data embedding, and rendering options.
- **CLI**: All `pipelex` commands now accept `--no-logo` to suppress the Pipelex banner in the terminal — useful to reduce tokens.

### Fixed

- **`find_project_root` Home Directory Bug**: The project root walker no longer considers the home directory (`~`) as a project root, even if it contains stray marker files like `package.json`.
- **Python 3.10 Compatibility**: Fixed `datetime.UTC` import (Python 3.11+) to use `datetime.timezone.utc`.
- **Graph Rendering:** Fixed dashed edge rendering for `PipeBatch` and `PipeParallel` relationships.
- **Image Generation Response Parsing:** Hardened image response parsing to handle varied provider response formats more robustly.
- **Helpful Error for `get_stuff_as(ListContent[T])`**: When users incorrectly call `get_stuff_as("name", ListContent[Something])` instead of `get_stuff_as_list("name", Something)`, the error message now explicitly suggests using `get_stuff_as_list()`.
- **PipeFunc `ListContent[T]` Validation**: Fixed validation rejecting valid `ListContent[T]` return types for array outputs (`T[]`). Previously, a function returning `ListContent[Expense]` would fail validation for `output = "Expense[]"` with a misleading error. The validation now correctly extracts and validates the generic type parameter from Pydantic's metadata.
- **PipeFunc Class Name Matching**: Fixed validation failing when the return type class and concept structure class are logically the same but loaded from different contexts. The validation now uses class name matching as a fallback, allowing `ListContent[Expense]` to match `Expense[]` even if the `Expense` class objects differ.
- Fixed `PipeImgGen` not properly converting `ImageContent` to custom subclasses (e.g., `Receipt(ImageContent)`). The pipe now uses `smart_dump()` before `model_validate()` to correctly instantiate the output concept's structure class.
- Corrected output directory creation logic in `pipelex run` to properly respect the `--no-graph` flag and configuration settings.
- Fixed a bug when trying to print HTML content in a TextContent object.
- Fixed the Pipelex CLI for generating structures, inputs, runner files.
- Fixed `@pipe_func` decorated functions showing "function not found" instead of explaining why the function is ineligible (e.g., missing return type annotation).
- Fixed PipeLLM with list output (e.g., `output = "Item[]"`) not producing `ListContent` when run inside a nested PipeSequence with `batch_over`.
- **Duplicate Pipe Error Message**: When a pipe code is declared in multiple `.plx` files (or twice in the same file), the error message now shows which bundle file(s) contain the conflicting declarations instead of a misleading message about "running the same pipe twice in the same pipeline".
- Fixed `pipelex build runner` and `pipelex build inputs` generating string placeholders (e.g., `"number_int | float"`) instead of numeric values for Number concepts with `int | float` union type fields.
- Fixed structure generation failing with `PydanticUserError` when a concept structure references native concepts (e.g., `native.Html`). The generator now properly resolves native concept refs to their content classes (e.g., `HtmlContent`) with correct imports.
- **Nested Image Handling**: Images nested within structured data are now properly replaced with `[Image N]` tokens. The `| with_images` filter and `ImageRegistry` system correctly extract images from complex nested structures.
- **`PipeCondition` Validation**: Output multiplicity validation now works correctly.
- **Error Reporting**: `PipeCompose` validation errors now include formatted details and failing field values.
- **Duplicate Pipeline Registration**: Running a pipeline from a file that was also part of a pre-loaded library (via `PIPELEXPATH`) no longer causes a duplicate domain registration error. The system now tracks absolute paths of loaded library files and skips files already loaded.
- **`pipelex build structures`**: Corrected output file naming and resolved import path generation.
- **`ConceptFactory.make_from_blueprint`**: Now correctly handles native concepts.

### Removed

- **Legacy Client & Execution Modules:** Removed `PipelexClient`, protocol files, and standalone `pipelex.pipeline.execute`/`pipelex.pipeline.start` modules (replaced by `PipelexRunner` and `mthds` package).
- **Legacy Config:** Removed `plx_config.py` and `.plx`-specific configuration references.
- **`pipelex kit` Command**: The kit commands have been removed from the main CLI. They are now internal tools for Pipelex contributors only, available via `pipelex-dev kit rules`.
- **`pipelex kit migrations` Command**: Removed entirely.
- **`pipelex kit remove-rules` Command**: Removed entirely.
- **PLX Syntax Agent Rules**: Removed `write_pipelex.md` and `run_pipelex.md` agent rules. These PLX syntax guides are no longer installed in client projects.
- **`[pipelex.kit_config]` Configuration**: Removed from client project configuration (`.pipelex/pipelex.toml`).
- **`openai_utils` Module**: Removed `pipelex.plugins.openai.openai_utils`; logic now in centralized image preparation utilities.
- **Pipeline Tracking feature**: Removed entirely, including the `pipelex/pipeline/track` module, `PipelineTracker` components, related configuration, tracker calls in pipe controllers, and associated documentation.
- **`Flow` Generator**: The old flow generator has been removed.

### Security

- **CSP Nonce Support:** Added Content Security Policy nonce for generated HTML graph outputs.

### Deprecated

- `pipelex_inference` backend in favor of `pipelex_gateway` (marked as "🛑 Legacy" in configuration template)

### For Contributors

- **Technical Documentation**: Added a new "Under the Hood" page documenting the `StuffArtefact` delegation pattern and image rendering architecture.
- **Enhanced Testing**: Added extensive unit and integration tests for the protocol-based rendering system, including nested image extraction and filter error conditions.
- **Agent Rules**: Added `pipelex_standards.md` outlining standards for the Pipelex configuration system, also included as rules for AI development agents.
- **Agent Rules**: New target `make agent-check` for faster linting.
- **⚠️ Breaking — Content Handling Overhaul**: `GeneratedImage` replaced by internal `GeneratedImageRawDetails`; `ImageContent` is now standard (without `base_64` field). `PipeExtract` outputs `PageContent` list directly. Content persistence now handled automatically by storage system.
- **⚠️ Breaking — Image Prompt Representation**: Redesigned `PromptImage` models—consolidated `PromptImagePath` and `PromptImageUrl` into `PromptImageUri`; now uses Pydantic discriminated union for URI, base64, and raw bytes sources.
- **Centralized Image Preparation**: Moved image fetching and base64 conversion logic to `pipelex.cogt.image.prompt_image_utils`, simplifying LLM provider plugins (Anthropic, Google, Mistral, OpenAI).
- **Unified Resource Loading**: Updated all file/URL reading components (PDF renderers, document extractors) to use the new URI handling system, replacing the legacy `pipelex.tools.misc.path_utils` module.
- **Async HTTP Fetching**: Renamed `fetch_file_from_url_httpx_async` to `fetch_file_from_url_httpx`; removed redundant synchronous version.
- **`PreparedImage` Abstraction**: New models (`PreparedImageHttpUrl`, `PreparedImageBase64`) representing images ready for LLM provider APIs.
- **Pipelex Gateway Model Management**: New CLI commands (`pipelex-dev update-gateway-models`, `pipelex-dev check-gateway-models`) and corresponding `make` targets (`ugm`, `cgm`) to generate and verify gateway model catalog. CI now validates this documentation is up-to-date.
- **Test Suite Pre-flight Check**: Verifies Gateway terms acceptance before running tests, providing clear error messages.
- **Content Rendering**: `StuffContent.rendered_*` methods now provide both synchronous and asynchronous variants.

### Migration Notes

- **Telemetry configuration migration**: If you have an existing `telemetry.toml`, rename:
    - `[posthog]` → `[custom_posthog]`
    - `[posthog.tracing]` → `[custom_posthog.tracing]`
    - `[posthog.tracing.capture]` → `[custom_posthog.tracing.capture]`
    - Or run `pipelex init telemetry --reset` to regenerate the file with the new structure

### Refactored

- **Anthropic Backend**: Internal streaming for standard completions to prevent SDK timeouts, configurable structured output timeout (`structured_output_timeout_seconds`), improved error mapping, and increased Bedrock Claude `max_tokens` (8K → 64K) with removal of `max_output_tokens_limit` constraint.
- **⚠️ Breaking — Pipe I/O Specification**: The output (and inputs) of a pipe is now a `StuffSpec` object that holds the concept and the multiplicity.
- **Naming Convention**: Renamed `domain` to `domain_code` where relevant.
- **Dry Run Methods**: Refactored the dry run methods of the `PipeAbstract` class.

## [v0.18.0b4] - 2026-02-23

### Added

- **Persistent Credential Storage (`~/.pipelex/.env`)**: `pipelex init` now prompts for missing API keys after backend selection and saves them to `~/.pipelex/.env` with `0600` permissions. Credentials are loaded automatically at startup (global defaults, overridden by project `.env`).
- **`pipelex init credentials` Command**: New standalone focus to re-enter API keys without resetting configuration. Scans enabled backends, detects missing env vars, and prompts only for those.
- **Package Management System:** Introduced a full package manager for MTHDS with `METHODS.toml` manifests, `methods.lock` lockfile generation, local path and remote Git-based dependency resolution (MVS), a local package cache (`~/.mthds/packages`), and a new `pipelex pkg` CLI command group (`init`, `list`, `add`, `lock`, `install`, `update`, `publish`, `search`, `inspect`, `graph`).
- **Hierarchical Domains:** Support for dot-separated domain namespaces (e.g., `legal.contracts.shareholder`) and cross-package references via `alias->domain.pipe` syntax.
- **PipelexRunner:** Introduced the `PipelexRunner` class as the primary entry point for executing pipelines, replacing `PipelexClient` and standalone `execute_pipeline`/`start_pipeline` functions.
- **Linting & Formatting:** Integrated `plxt` (Pipelex Tools) for formatting and linting `.mthds` and `.toml` files, including CI/CD checks alongside `ruff`.
- **JSON Schema:** Automatic generation of `mthds_schema.json` for standard definition, IDE validation, and auto-completion.
- **Dev CLI:** Added `pipelex-dev` CLI for internal development tasks (e.g., schema generation).
- **CSP Nonce Support:** Added Content Security Policy nonce support for generated HTML graphs (Mermaid/ReactFlow) to enable secure rendering in VS Code webviews.
- **OpenRouter Backend:** Added OpenRouter as an inference backend with 337 chat model definitions and 14 image generation models.

- **Quieter `pipelex init`**: Removed verbose file listing and reset messages from config initialization output.
- **`pipelex init` Help Text**: Detailed focus option descriptions now shown in `pipelex init --help` explaining each focus (`all`, `config`, `credentials`, `inference`, `routing`, `telemetry`, `agreement`).
- **File Extension:** Pipeline definitions now use `.mthds` instead of `.plx`; the project refers to "Methods" (MTHDS) rather than "Pipelex workflows".
- **Syntax:** In `PipeParallel` definitions, `parallels` field renamed to `branches`; `plx_config` in `pipelex.toml` renamed to `mthds_config`.
- **Documentation:** Comprehensive update to reflect `.mthds` file format, package management, and new project structure.

### Fixed

- **`find_project_root` Home Directory Bug**: The project root walker no longer considers the home directory (`~`) as a project root, even if it contains stray marker files like `package.json`.

### Security

- **CSP Nonce Support:** Added Content Security Policy nonce for generated HTML graph outputs.

## [v0.18.0b3] - 2026-02-11

**Highlights:**

 - **Agent CLI (`pipelex-agent`)**: New machine-first CLI for AI agents with structured JSON output for all commands (`build`, `run`, `validate`, `inputs`, `concept`, `pipe`, `assemble`, `graph`, `models`, `doctor`).
 - **LLM Reasoning Controls**: Unified support for "Thinking" models (Chain of Thought) with `reasoning_effort`, `reasoning_budget`, and `thinking_mode` parameters. Supports Anthropic Extended Thinking, Google Gemini Thinking, OpenAI Reasoning (`o1`/`o3`), and Mistral/Magistral models. Includes new presets: `$deep-analysis` and `$quick-reasoning`.
 - **Image-to-Image Generation**: `PipeImgGen` now supports input images via `input_images` field, with `InputImagesTaxonomy` for provider-specific handling and variable reference detection (`{{ var }}`, `$var`, `@var`) in prompts.
 - **PipeCompose "Construct" Mode**: New `construct` mode for building structured objects (dictionaries/Pydantic models) directly from variables.
 - **Nested concepts in inline structures**: You can now define nested structures for your concepts in your `.plx` files. Learn more here: [Nested Concepts in Inline Structures](https://docs.pipelex.com/latest/building-methods/concepts/inline-structures).

### Added
 - **Builder Auto-Repair**: Self-healing capabilities including auto-generation of undeclared concepts, multiplicity mismatch fixes, and pruning of unreachable pipes/unused concepts.
 - **Concept Field Features**: Added `choices` support (compiles to `Literal` types/Enums) and explicit `list` type with `item_type`/`item_concept_ref`.
 - **PipeFunc Execution Error Context**: When a `@pipe_func` function fails during execution, the error message now includes detailed context: the function name, actual input values from working memory, expected output type, and the original error with its type. This makes debugging PipeFunc errors much easier.
 - **`pipelex build output` CLI Command**: New command to generate example output JSON for a pipe, complementing the existing `pipelex build inputs` command. Shows the expected output structure based on the pipe's output concept type, with multiplicity support. For pipes with `native.Anything` output (e.g., `PipeCondition` with different mapped pipe outputs), displays all possible outputs from mapped pipes.
 - **Telemetry System**: Introduced anonymous usage tracking and exception capture for CLI commands (`graph render`), reporting to both user-configured and Pipelex analytics endpoints.
 - **PipeExtract Operator Validation**: Added strict input validation that raises configuration errors for incompatible input types or when document-specific parameters are used with image inputs.
 - **PipeCondition Output Auto-Fix in Builder Loop**: The pipe builder now automatically fixes `PipeCondition` output concept errors during validation. If all mapped pipes have the same output, the `PipeCondition` output is set to that concept; otherwise it's set to `native.Anything`.
 - **PipeFunc Return Type Validation**: Added validation to ensure that a `PipeFunc` function's return type matches the output concept's structure class.
 - **URL Validation on `ImageContent` and `DocumentContent`**: Both models validate external resources (HTTP/HTTPS URLs via HEAD request, local file paths via existence check) through a `validate_resources()` method called during pipeline execution (`validate_before_run`) rather than at model instantiation. Internal URIs (`data:`, `pipelex-storage://`) skip validation entirely. Validation is skipped in dry-run mode where inputs use mock URLs.
 - **Literal Type Support in Dry Run Mocks**: `DryRunFactory` now detects `Literal` type annotations (including `Optional[Literal[...]]`) and generates valid mock values by randomly picking from the allowed choices instead of producing invalid random strings.
 - **Literal Type Support in `pipelex build inputs`/`pipelex build output`**: The concept representation generator now handles `Literal` fields by picking a random value from the allowed choices, and generates mock URL patterns for `url` fields.
 - **Literal Error Handling in Validation Messages**: Pydantic validation error formatting now recognizes `literal_error` types and displays them as "Invalid choice errors" with the actual value and expected options.
 - **`PipeRunError` Catching in Bundle Validation**: `validate_bundle` now catches `PipeRunError` during dry run and wraps it in `ValidateBundleError` with a clear message.
 - **`ValidationError` Catching in Pipeline Execution**: `execute_pipeline` now catches Pydantic `ValidationError` from input construction, formats the errors, and raises a `PipeExecutionError` with a clear message.
 - **Broader Error Handling in CLI `pipelex run`**: The CLI run command now catches `PipelexError` in addition to `PipelineExecutionError`, providing better error messages for failures that occur outside the pipeline execution itself.
 - **Content Filenames:** Added `filename` field to `ImageContent` and `DocumentContent`, with auto-population from local file paths via new `extract_filename_from_uri` helper.
 - **Batch Validation Error Type:** Introduced `PipeValidationErrorType.BATCH_ITEM_NAME_COLLISION` for naming conflicts in batch operations.
 - **Documentation:** Added naming convention rules to `builder.plx` and `pipe_design.plx` (batch input lists should be plural, item names singular).

### Changed
 - **Model Deck Updates**: Default premium model now `claude-4.6-opus`; added Mistral models (`mistral-small-3.2`, `mistral-large`, `magistral` series) and `gpt-5` placeholders.
 - **Jinja2 Rendering**: Image objects now replaced with placeholders (e.g., `[Image 1]`) during text generation; async filters only registered in async environments.
 - **Backend Configurations**: Added `effort_to_level_map` and `effort_to_budget_maps` for reasoning translation; disabled Google Vertex AI by default.
 - **Dependencies**: Updated `pypdfium2`, `anthropic`, and `mistralai` version constraints.
 - **`pipelex run --dry-run`**: No longer pretty prints the main_stuff output, matching the expected behavior for dry runs where no actual inference occurs.
 - **`pipelex build structures` Command**: Now uses a lightweight loading mechanism that only processes domains and concepts, skipping pipe loading and validation entirely. This fixes the chicken-and-egg problem where structure generation would fail due to pipe validation errors before the structures were even created. Added `--force` / `-f` flag to regenerate all structures without checking if classes already exist.
 - **Test Profile System**: Refactored integration tests to use a new configuration system (`.pipelex/test_profiles.toml`) with `dev`, `ci`, and `full` profiles for controlling which AI models are used in parametrized tests, replacing runtime filtering and hardcoded model lists.
 - **`pipelex run --graph` Flag**: Now acts as an override for `pipelex.toml` settings instead of defaulting to `true`.
 - **Default Image Generation Models**: Updated in `base_deck.toml`: `base-img-gen`: `flux-2-pro`, `best-img-gen`: `nano-banana-pro`, `fast-img-gen`: `gpt-image-1-mini`
 - **Remote Configuration**: Updated service URL to version 3.
 - **GatewayExtractWorker**: Now checks model capabilities before attempting image captioning.
 - Change the output validation of `PipeCondition`: If all mapped pipes have the same output concept, `PipeCondition`'s output MUST be that same concept. If mapped pipes have different output concepts, `PipeCondition`'s output MUST be the native concept `Anything`.
 - **CLI**: Changed `pipelex validate all` to `pipelex validate --all` (or `-a`).
 - **StructuredContent.rendered_html()**: Now recursively calls `rendered_html()` on nested `StuffContent` fields instead of using json2html conversion. Also skips `None` values and uses HTML table format.
 - **Batch Pipe Validation:** Enforced stricter naming rules for batch specs—`input_item_name` must differ from `input_list_name` and not shadow existing input keys, with clearer error messages suggesting plural/singular conventions.

### Fixed
 - **Helpful Error for `get_stuff_as(ListContent[T])`**: When users incorrectly call `get_stuff_as("name", ListContent[Something])` instead of `get_stuff_as_list("name", Something)`, the error message now explicitly suggests using `get_stuff_as_list()`.
 - **PipeFunc `ListContent[T]` Validation**: Fixed validation rejecting valid `ListContent[T]` return types for array outputs (`T[]`). Previously, a function returning `ListContent[Expense]` would fail validation for `output = "Expense[]"` with a misleading error. The validation now correctly extracts and validates the generic type parameter from Pydantic's metadata.
 - **PipeFunc Class Name Matching**: Fixed validation failing when the return type class and concept structure class are logically the same but loaded from different contexts. The validation now uses class name matching as a fallback, allowing `ListContent[Expense]` to match `Expense[]` even if the `Expense` class objects differ.
 - Fixed `PipeImgGen` not properly converting `ImageContent` to custom subclasses (e.g., `Receipt(ImageContent)`). The pipe now uses `smart_dump()` before `model_validate()` to correctly instantiate the output concept's structure class.
 - Corrected output directory creation logic in `pipelex run` to properly respect the `--no-graph` flag and configuration settings.
 - Fixed a bug when trying to print HTML content in a TextContent object.
 - Fixed the Pipelex CLI for generating structures, inputs, runner files.
 - Fixed `@pipe_func` decorated functions showing "function not found" instead of explaining why the function is ineligible (e.g., missing return type annotation).
 - Fixed PipeLLM with list output (e.g., `output = "Item[]"`) not producing `ListContent` when run inside a nested PipeSequence with `batch_over`.
 - **Duplicate Pipe Error Message**: When a pipe code is declared in multiple `.plx` files (or twice in the same file), the error message now shows which bundle file(s) contain the conflicting declarations instead of a misleading message about "running the same pipe twice in the same pipeline".
 - Fixed `pipelex build runner` and `pipelex build inputs` generating string placeholders (e.g., `"number_int | float"`) instead of numeric values for Number concepts with `int | float` union type fields.
 - Fixed structure generation failing with `PydanticUserError` when a concept structure references native concepts (e.g., `native.Html`). The generator now properly resolves native concept refs to their content classes (e.g., `HtmlContent`) with correct imports.

### Removed
 - **`pipelex kit` Command**: The kit commands have been removed from the main CLI. They are now internal tools for Pipelex contributors only, available via `pipelex-dev kit rules`.
 - **`pipelex kit migrations` Command**: Removed entirely.
 - **`pipelex kit remove-rules` Command**: Removed entirely.
 - **PLX Syntax Agent Rules**: Removed `write_pipelex.md` and `run_pipelex.md` agent rules. These PLX syntax guides are no longer installed in client projects.
 - **`[pipelex.kit_config]` Configuration**: Removed from client project configuration (`.pipelex/pipelex.toml`).

## [v0.18.0b2] - 2026-01-20

**Highlights:**

- **Pipelex Gateway** — The deprecated `pipelex_inference` backend is now replaced by `pipelex_gateway`, featuring remote model configuration fetching so you always have access to the latest models without updating Pipelex.

    **Getting your API key:**

    1. Get your API key at [app.pipelex.com](https://app.pipelex.com/)
    2. Add it to your `.env` file: `PIPELEX_GATEWAY_API_KEY=your-key-here`

    **Gateway Supported models — included with the Free API Key**

    - **Language Models (LLM):**
        - OpenAI: all models up to GPT-5.2 and Codex
        - Anthropic: Claude 3.7 Sonnet through Claude 4.5 Haiku/Sonnet/Opus
        - Google: Gemini 2.0/2.5 Flash, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Gemini 3.0 Flash/Pro
        - xAI: Grok 3/mini, Grok 4 (+ fast reasoning variants)
        - Open-source: Mistral Large 3, DeepSeek v3.1/3.2/Speciale, GPT-OSS 20B/120B1, Kimi K2, Phi-4, Qwen3-VL 235B
    - **Document Extraction:** Mistral Document AI, Azure Document Intelligence, DeepSeek OCR
    - **Image Generation:** GPT-Image 1/1.5, Flux 2 Pro, Nano Banana/Pro

    **Accepting the Terms of Service:**

    When you run `pipelex init`, you'll be prompted to accept the Gateway terms of service. By using Pipelex Gateway, telemetry is automatically enabled and identified by your API key (hashed for security) to monitor service quality and enforce fair usage. **We only collect technical data** (model names, token counts, latency, error rates)—never your prompts, completions, or business data. See our [Privacy Policy](https://go.pipelex.com/privacy-policy).

    **⚠️ Migration deadline:** If you were using `pipelex_inference`, please migrate soon—the legacy service will be shut down within few days. Get your new Gateway key at [app.pipelex.com](https://app.pipelex.com/).

- **Execution Graph Visualization System** (preview feature) — Comprehensive tracing and visualization for pipeline executions.

    **CLI:** `--graph` flag on `pipelex run` generates execution graphs. New `pipelex graph render <graph.json>` command for post-run rendering.

    **Viewers:** Interactive ReactFlow viewer (`reactflow.html`) with pan/zoom and node inspector. Mermaid diagrams (`mermaidflow.html`) with subgraphs and clickable nodes.

    **Makefile:** `make view-graph` (`vg`) and `make serve-graph` (`sg`) to start a local graph viewer.

- **Pydantic Structure Generation** — Two new CLI commands bridge Pipelex's declarative concepts with your Python code:

    **`pipelex build structures /library_dir/`** — Generates Pydantic models from all concept definitions found in the specified library directory. Now you have your structures as Python code: you can iterate on them, add custom validation functions, or use them as type hints in your code.

    **`pipelex build runner`** — Now automatically generates both the Python runner file AND the required Pydantic structures. When you run this command, it creates a complete, ready-to-execute Python script that imports the generated structures, so you can immediately use typed objects in your pipeline code.

    See the [Build Commands documentation](https://docs.pipelex.com/latest/tools/cli/build/) for usage examples.

- **New Backends & Models**:
    - **Hugging Face Inference** — Support for Hugging Face Inference API, including `qwen-image` text-to-image model.
    - Google `gemini-3.0-flash-preview`
    - Mistral OCR latest model `mistral-ocr-2512`
    - **Scaleway** inference provider support for open-source models
    - **Portkey AI** backend integration for unified access to multiple models through a single API key

- **Document Support in `PipeLLM`** — Include `Document` objects (like PDFs) directly in prompts using `@variable` or `$variable` syntax. Supports single documents, multiple documents, and lists, combinable with text and image inputs.

- **`PipeCompose` Construct Mode** — New mode for deterministically building `StructuredContent` objects without an LLM. Compose fields from working memory variables, fixed values, templates, and nested structures.

- **Content Storage System** — Configurable storage for generated artifacts (images, extracted pages). Supports `local` filesystem (`.pipelex/storage/`), `in_memory`, **AWS S3** (`pip install pipelex[s3]`), and **Google Cloud Storage** (`pip install pipelex[gcp-storage]`). Cloud providers support both public URLs and time-limited signed URLs. Content referenced via stable `pipelex-storage://` URIs.

- **Langfuse & OpenTelemetry Observability** — New OpenTelemetry-based observability system enables powerful tracing and Evals through Langfuse integration. Also supports OTLP-compatible backends (Datadog, Honeycomb, etc.). Configured via `.pipelex/telemetry.toml`.

- **Python 3.14 Support** — Officially tested and supported.

### Added

- **`--library-dir` CLI Option**: `--library-dir` / `-L` option for `pipelex run`, `pipelex validate`, and `pipelex build` subcommands (`one-shot-pipe`, `partial-pipe`) to specify additional directories for searching pipe definitions. Can be specified multiple times.
- **Automatic File Loading**: The core pipeline execution functions (`pipelex.execute_pipeline`, `pipelex.start_pipeline`) can now directly load a pipeline from a file path via a new `bundle_uri` parameter.
- **Dry Run Mode**: `pipelex run --dry-run` executes pipeline logic without API calls, useful for validating structure and generating orchestration graphs. Combine with `--mock-inputs` to generate mock data for missing required inputs.
- **`| with_images` Jinja2 Filter**: Explicitly extract and include all nested images from complex data structures (e.g., `Page` objects or custom concepts with `Image` fields). Renders the object's text representation while making associated images available to the LLM.
- **System Prompt Media Support**: Reference images and documents in `system_prompt` using the same `$variable` and `@variable` syntax as the user `prompt`.
- **Pipelex Gateway Service**: Terms of service management via `.pipelex/pipelex_service.toml` and interactive acceptance flow in `pipelex init` and `pipelex init agreement`.
- **Gateway Available Models Documentation**: Auto-generated reference of all LLM, Document Extraction, and Image Generation models available through the Gateway.
- **Configurable Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff for inference API calls, configurable in `pipelex.toml` under `[cogt.tenacity_config]`
- **Context Manager Support**: The `Pipelex` class now supports `with Pipelex.make(): ...` for graceful shutdown
- **Validation Improvements**:
    - Pipelex Bundle concept keys: prevent bundles from re-creating a native concept
    - `PipeSequence`: output multiplicity must match the last step's output multiplicity
    - `PipeFunc`: output multiplicity must match the function return type (`ListContent` subclass for multiplicity=true)
- **Rendering Protocols**: Three new `@runtime_checkable` protocols (`ImageRenderable`, `TagRenderable`, `TextFormatRenderable`) to formalize the interaction between data types and Jinja2 filters.
- **Unified URI Handling System**: New `pipelex.tools.uri` module providing type-safe parsing for HTTP/HTTPS URLs, local file paths, file URIs, `pipelex-storage://` URIs, and base64 data URLs.
- **Automatic Input Data Storage**: Pipeline pre-processing step that converts large `data:` URLs in an `ImageContent` or `DocumentContent` into `pipelex-storage://` URIs for improved performance, by storing the data with the configured storage provider. Configurable via `is_normalize_data_urls_to_storage` in `pipelex.toml`.
- **`pipelex build inputs` Command**: New CLI command to generate example input JSON files for pipes. Supports `--library-dir` (`-L`) to specify library directories.
- **Pipe Code Syntax Validation**: Bundle validation now checks that pipe codes and `main_pipe` values use valid snake_case syntax, with proper error categorization (`INVALID_PIPE_CODE_SYNTAX`).

### Fixed

- **Nested Image Handling**: Images nested within structured data are now properly replaced with `[Image N]` tokens. The `| with_images` filter and `ImageRegistry` system correctly extract images from complex nested structures.
- **`PipeCondition` Validation**: Output multiplicity validation now works correctly.
- **Error Reporting**: `PipeCompose` validation errors now include formatted details and failing field values.
- **Duplicate Pipeline Registration**: Running a pipeline from a file that was also part of a pre-loaded library (via `PIPELEXPATH`) no longer causes a duplicate domain registration error. The system now tracks absolute paths of loaded library files and skips files already loaded.
- **`pipelex build structures`**: Corrected output file naming and resolved import path generation.
- **`ConceptFactory.make_from_blueprint`**: Now correctly handles native concepts.

### Changed

- **Jinja2 Integration Refactored to Protocol-Based Approach**: Replaced the `Jinja2Registry` singleton and handler functions with a decoupled protocol-based system, eliminating circular dependencies between the template layer and core domain logic.
- **`StuffArtefact` Redesigned as Delegation Adapter**: Now a lightweight, immutable adapter that delegates attribute access directly to underlying `Stuff` and `StuffContent` objects, improving performance and providing more intuitive field access.
- **Image Extraction Moved to Content Types**: `StructuredContent`, `ListContent`, `ImageContent`, and `TextAndImagesContent` now implement the `ImageRenderable` protocol, replacing centralized handler logic.
- **⚠️ Breaking**: User override config renamed from `pipelex_super.toml` to `pipelex_override.toml`.
- **Image Generation Architecture**: Refactored to taxonomy-based approach. Standardizes parameter translation (`aspect_ratio`, `quality`, `output_format`) to provider-specific APIs.
- **Document Extraction Improvements**: `pypdfium2` extractor now extracts embedded images from PDFs. Response parsing uses dedicated Pydantic schemas for validation.
- **Default Model Change**: `extract_text_from_visuals` deck now defaults to `azure-document-intelligence`
- **`pipelex_inference` replaced by `pipelex_gateway`**: See Highlights for migration details. New `PIPELEX_GATEWAY_API_KEY` environment variable; default routing profiles updated to `pipelex_gateway_first`.
- **Telemetry System Split**: Now two separate streams:
    1. Pipelex Gateway telemetry for service monitoring (never collects prompts/completions/business data)
    2. Custom telemetry to user-configured backends
    3. Config updated accordingly (`telemetry.toml`):
      - Renamed `[posthog]` to `[custom_posthog]` to distinguish user's PostHog from Pipelex Gateway telemetry
      - Added new `[custom_portkey]` section with `force_debug_enabled` and `force_tracing_enabled` settings
- **Main Configuration Overrides Updated** (`.pipelex/pipelex.toml`):
    - `pipelex_override.toml` (final override) renamed from `pipelex_super.toml` to `pipelex_override.toml` and moved from repo root to `.pipelex/` directory
    - `telemetry_override.toml` (personal telemetry settings)
    - `is_generate_cost_report_file_enabled` default changed from `true` to `false`

- **Documentation**:
  - Clarified **Setup (first run)** vs **Configuration (TOML reference)**, added a Setup overview page, and added contributor docs for configuration defaults/overrides.
  - Added the "Under the Hood" page documenting the execution graph tracing system.
- **`pipelex init`**: Now creates a documented `telemetry.toml` template instead of prompting for preferences
- **Model Catalog Updated**: Latest models (gpt-5.1, claude-4.5-opus, gemini-3.0-pro, etc.) and updated waterfalls in `base_deck.toml`
- **Model Constraints Refactored**: From simple lists to structured `valued_constraints` dictionaries (e.g., `valued_constraints = { fixed_temperature = 1 }`)
- **OpenAI Responses API**: New implementation now differentiates between `openai_completions` and `openai_responses`
- **CLI Initialization**: Commands refactored to use centralized `Pipelex` initialization factory for improved error handling
- **`pipelex doctor`**: Enhanced to detect outdated `telemetry.toml` formats and suggest fixes
- **`--output-dir` Option**: The `runner`, `structures`, and `inputs` CLI commands now accept this option
- **Cost Report**: Now displays a note clarifying that it only includes LLM costs
- **`description` Field Now Required**: In `PipeAbstract`, `PipeBlueprint`, and `PipeSpec` classes.
- **Configuration**: New `[pipelex.pipeline_execution_config.graph_config]` section in `pipelex.toml` for fine-grained control over graph generation, data embedding, and rendering options.
- **CLI**: All `pipelex` commands now accept `--no-logo` to suppress the Pipelex banner in the terminal — useful to reduce tokens.

### Removed

- **`openai_utils` Module**: Removed `pipelex.plugins.openai.openai_utils`; logic now in centralized image preparation utilities.
- **Pipeline Tracking feature**: Removed entirely, including the `pipelex/pipeline/track` module, `PipelineTracker` components, related configuration, tracker calls in pipe controllers, and associated documentation.
- **`Flow` Generator**: The old flow generator has been removed.

### Deprecated

- `pipelex_inference` backend in favor of `pipelex_gateway` (marked as "🛑 Legacy" in configuration template)

### For Contributors

- **Technical Documentation**: Added a new "Under the Hood" page documenting the `StuffArtefact` delegation pattern and image rendering architecture.
- **Enhanced Testing**: Added extensive unit and integration tests for the protocol-based rendering system, including nested image extraction and filter error conditions.
- **Agent Rules**: Added `pipelex_standards.md` outlining standards for the Pipelex configuration system, also included as rules for AI development agents.
- **Agent Rules**: New target `make agent-check` for faster linting.
- **⚠️ Breaking — Content Handling Overhaul**: `GeneratedImage` replaced by internal `GeneratedImageRawDetails`; `ImageContent` is now standard (without `base_64` field). `PipeExtract` outputs `PageContent` list directly. Content persistence now handled automatically by storage system.
- **⚠️ Breaking — Image Prompt Representation**: Redesigned `PromptImage` models—consolidated `PromptImagePath` and `PromptImageUrl` into `PromptImageUri`; now uses Pydantic discriminated union for URI, base64, and raw bytes sources.
- **Centralized Image Preparation**: Moved image fetching and base64 conversion logic to `pipelex.cogt.image.prompt_image_utils`, simplifying LLM provider plugins (Anthropic, Google, Mistral, OpenAI).
- **Unified Resource Loading**: Updated all file/URL reading components (PDF renderers, document extractors) to use the new URI handling system, replacing the legacy `pipelex.tools.misc.path_utils` module.
- **Async HTTP Fetching**: Renamed `fetch_file_from_url_httpx_async` to `fetch_file_from_url_httpx`; removed redundant synchronous version.
- **`PreparedImage` Abstraction**: New models (`PreparedImageHttpUrl`, `PreparedImageBase64`) representing images ready for LLM provider APIs.
- **Pipelex Gateway Model Management**: New CLI commands (`pipelex-dev update-gateway-models`, `pipelex-dev check-gateway-models`) and corresponding `make` targets (`ugm`, `cgm`) to generate and verify gateway model catalog. CI now validates this documentation is up-to-date.
- **Test Suite Pre-flight Check**: Verifies Gateway terms acceptance before running tests, providing clear error messages.
- **Content Rendering**: `StuffContent.rendered_*` methods now provide both synchronous and asynchronous variants.

### Migration Notes

- **Telemetry configuration migration**: If you have an existing `telemetry.toml`, rename:
    - `[posthog]` → `[custom_posthog]`
    - `[posthog.tracing]` → `[custom_posthog.tracing]`
    - `[posthog.tracing.capture]` → `[custom_posthog.tracing.capture]`
    - Or run `pipelex init telemetry --reset` to regenerate the file with the new structure

### Refactored

- **Anthropic Backend**: Internal streaming for standard completions to prevent SDK timeouts, configurable structured output timeout (`structured_output_timeout_seconds`), improved error mapping, and increased Bedrock Claude `max_tokens` (8K → 64K) with removal of `max_output_tokens_limit` constraint.
- **⚠️ Breaking — Pipe I/O Specification**: The output (and inputs) of a pipe is now a `StuffSpec` object that holds the concept and the multiplicity.
- **Naming Convention**: Renamed `domain` to `domain_code` where relevant.
- **Dry Run Methods**: Refactored the dry run methods of the `PipeAbstract` class.

## [v0.17.6] - 2026-02-14

### Added

- **Claude Code GitHub Actions**: Added `claude.yml` workflow for interactive Claude Code assistance on issues and PR comments, and `claude-code-review.yml` workflow for automated code review on pull requests.

## [v0.17.5] - 2026-01-16

- Added target `make docs-deploy-404` to deploy the 404.html file to the gh-pages root for versionless URL redirects.

## [v0.17.4] - 2026-01-16

### Added

- Added the `mike` dependency to support mutiple docs versions. `version` plugin added to the MkDocs configuration, make targets and CI scripts.

## [v0.17.3] - 2025-12-01

### Fixed

- Fixed the issue with the `find_files_in_dir` force including virtual environment directories: Now it force includes the `pipelex.builder` directory.
- Fixed a bug with the comparison of Concept structures.

## [v0.17.2] - 2025-12-01

### Added

- **New AI models support**: Added GPT-5.1, Claude 4.5 Opus, and Gemini 3 Preview to the available models.
- **Codex Cloud support**: Added support for running Pipelex in Codex Cloud environments with appropriate configuration and testing capabilities.
- **Enhanced file discovery**: Added `force_include_dirs` parameter to the `find_files_in_dir` function. This allows specific directories to be force included in the search even when they are nested within excluded directories. For example, you can now exclude `.venv` while still including `.venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/pipelex` for loading Pipelex libraries from installed packages.
- Added validation of the PipeLLM inputs at the blueprint level.
- Added a xfailed test for `PipeCondition`: if one of the outcome of the pipe is `continue`, it does nothing, but the main stuff still points towards the last step. Therefore when trying to get the main stuff out of the working memory as a specific type, it fails.

### Changed

- Backend fallback now only activates when explicitly opted-in, giving users more control over model selection.
- Renamed and improved the Azure Image Generation SDK implementation.
- Enhanced language spec examples, operator details, and added Viewpoint documentation.

### Fixed

- Fixed kit rules to be idempotent and work correctly across multiple executions.

## [v0.17.1] - 2025-11-27

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug in the `find_files_in_dir` function.

## [v0.17.0] - 2025-11-27

**Highlights:** - Previously, in the pipelex config files (`.toml` files in the `.pipelex/` directory, such as `.pipelex/pipelex.toml`, but also the routing profiles files, backends, etc.), when an array was overridden, the new array was concatenated to the old array. Now, the new array overrides the old array.

### Fixed

- **Relaxed concept structure field naming restrictions**: Users can now use field names like `content`, `stuff_code`, `stuff_name`, and `concept` in their concept structures without conflicts. Internal metadata fields in stuff artefacts now use underscore prefixes (`_stuff_name`, `_content_class`, `_concept_code`, `_stuff_code`, `_content`) to avoid collisions with user-defined fields. Reserved field names (Pydantic BaseModel attributes like `model_config`, `model_fields`, etc.) and field names starting with underscore remain forbidden with improved error messages that clearly specify which fields are problematic.

### Changed

- Modified the GHA `version-check.yml` so that the check of the version is only applying to release branches.
- Removed the `pyproject.toml` file from the build.
- No more implicit concepts. A concept reference has a domain and a code. If there is no domain, it should be a native concept, or it is declared in the same bundle.

### Refactored

- The `find_files_in_dir` function was coded in 3 different places, now it's in `pipelex/tools/misc/file_utils.py`, and accepts `excluded_dirs`.
- Refactored the Pipe factories: Centralized everything in the `PipeFactory` class.

## [v0.16.0] - 2025-11-25

**Highlights:** - Library manager now supports multiple libraries. You can now have multiple libraries in your project, each with its own set of concepts, pipes, and stuffs.
You can run the same pipe at the same times as much as you want, with different inputs. 
Side effets: Unit tests now run in 30s.

### Fixed

- Fixed some issues with inputs of pipes: The validation methods was not detecting misconceptions with implicit concepts.

### Changed

- Improved pipe builder by auto-fixing errors, forcing consistency in the inputs and outputs of the pipes.

### Refactor

- PipeCondition: Moved the expression/expression_template choosing to the factory.
- Moved a lot of validation to blueprints instead of pipe instances.
- Refactored the Blueprint validation errors, and validation functions.
- Refactored the PipelexInterpreter validation errors.
- Refactored the pipe builder validation loop.
- Reorganized the unit tests, and added new ones.
- Reorganized the config files.
- Refactored methods `execute_pipeline` and `start_pipeline`.
- Moved `dev_cli` to `cli.dev_cli`.

## [v0.15.7] - 2025-11-18

### Fixed
 - Fixed issue with `get_console()` function returning `None` if Pipelex is not initialized. Now always defaults to `stderr` if not set.

## [v0.15.6] - 2025-11-18

### Contributors
 - Welcome to our new contributor @0x090909 (yup, that's his github username) for his work on Groq support in PR #445! 🎉

### Added
 - **Improved configuration repair**: New `--fix` option for `pipelex doctor` command that interactively detects and repairs outdated or invalid backend configuration files using latest templates from the Pipelex kit.
 - **Developer CLI & tooling**: New internal `pipelex-dev` CLI for project maintenance with `check-config-sync` command to verify user-facing configuration templates (`.pipelex/`) are synchronized with package's internal kit configs. Includes `make check-config-sync` command and CI check (`lint-check.yml`) to enforce synchronization.
 - **Enhanced test infrastructure**: Integration tests now automatically parameterized to run against all supported backend routing profiles. Tests are intelligently skipped at collection time if a model is not supported by the active backend profile, with a summary of skipped tests provided at session end.
 - **New routing profiles**: Added `all_groq` and `all_pipelex_inference` routing profiles.
 - **Vision support flag**: Added `is_vision_supported` property to `LLMWorkerAbstract` class for explicit checks of model vision capabilities.
- **New type of `StuffContent`**: `JSONContent` to support an arbitrary JSON object as input or output of a pipe.
 - **Azure image generation**: Support for image generation models via Azure OpenAI backend using `gpt-image-1`.

### Changed
 - **Unified structured output**: Complete overhaul of structured generation settings. Replaced global configuration setting with new `structure_method` parameter in backend `.toml` files (configurable at backend level in `[defaults]` or per individual model). Expanded `StructureMethod` enum to include dozens of modes supported by `instructor`, enabling fine-grained control over provider-specific features like OpenAI Structured Outputs or Anthropic Tools, and various JSON-based modes.
 - **Groq integration**: Updated to use standard `openai` SDK, simplifying integration.
 - **Default configurations**: All official backend providers now enabled by default after `pipelex init`. Default prompting style changed from `ticks` to `xml`.
 - **Code & test organization**: Unit test suite reorganized from `tests/unit/core` and other directories into unified `tests/unit/pipelex/` structure. Integration test fixtures modularized from `conftest.py` into separate files within `tests/integration/pipelex/fixtures/`.
 - **Console output settings**: Added `console_print_target` and `console_log_target` settings in `pipelex.toml` for redirecting output to `stdout` or `stderr`, with CLI and logging refactored to use centralized console instance. This makes it easier to support MCP communication based on stdio.

### Fixed
 - Improved Pydantic validation error messages when loading backend configurations to clearly indicate the specific file and model containing the error.

### Removed
 - **Perplexity backend**: Default configuration for Perplexity AI backend (`perplexity.toml`) removed from kit (it was obsolete, it will come back).
 - **Groq plugin**: Dedicated `pipelex/plugins/groq` plugin removed (now uses standard `openai` SDK).
 - **Global instructor config**: Global `is_openai_structured_output_enabled` setting, replaced by per-model `structure_method` approach.

## [v0.15.4] - 2025-11-12

### Added
 - **Enhanced `pipelex build` Command**: Now generates a self-contained directory (e.g., `results/pipeline_01/`) containing `bundle.plx`, `inputs.json`, `run_{pipe_code}.py`, `bundle_view.html`, and `bundle_view.svg`. New CLI options: `--output-name (-o)` for custom base name, `--output-dir` for custom directory, and `--no-extras` to generate only the `.plx` file.
 - **CLI Readiness Check**: Verifies that a virtual environment is active for development installations.
 - **Model Deck Presets**: Added `llm_for_creativity` and `cheap_llm_for_creativity` model waterfalls, plus `[cogt.model_deck_config]` section in `pipelex.toml` for configuring model fallback behavior.
 - WIP: **Groq Inference Backend Support**: Integrated full support for the Groq API with configuration file (`.pipelex/inference/backends/groq.toml`), model specifications, costs, capabilities, new model aliases (`base-groq`, `fast-groq`, `vision-groq`), and routing profile (`all_groq`).

### Changed
 - **CLI Output and Visualization**: Overhauled command-line output with rich, table-based layouts for pipeline components. Final output of `pipelex run` is now pretty-printed and adapts to content type.
 - **Documentation**: Updated "Get Started" and "Build Reliable AI Workflows" to reflect new directory-based build output and CLI options.
 - **Internal Code Refactoring**: Reorganized exception hierarchy into dedicated `exceptions.py` files per module, centralized validation logic into `validation.py` modules, added `ValueError` to blueprints, and removed unused exceptions for improved maintainability.
- Updated pytest to `>=9.0.1` to support their new `pyproject.toml` config format.

### Fixed
 - Adjusted default temperature for `llm_for_testing_gen_object` preset from `0.5` to `0.1` for more deterministic structured data generation.
 - Corrected `LLM_FOR_VISUAL_DESIGN` skill in `pipe_llm_spec` to point to `cheap_llm_for_creativity` preset.
 - Standardized input variable names in `pipe_llm_vision.plx` from `imageA`/`imageB` to `image_a`/`image_b`.

### Removed
 - Deleted `pipelex/core/validation_errors.py` file as part of exception hierarchy refactoring.


## [v0.15.3] - 2025-11-07

### Fixed
- Fixed weird import issues with `posthog` and `StrEnum`

## [v0.15.2] - 2025-11-07

### Fixed
- Fixed resetting routing profile when calling with `--reset` flag in `pipelex init`

## [v0.15.1] - 2025-11-07

### Fixed
- Bumped OpenAI dependency to `>=1.108.1` to support their breaking change: "change optional parameter type from `NotGiven` to `Omit`"
- `get_selected_backend_keys()` now correctly considers backends enabled by default (like before v0.15.0)

## [v0.15.0] - 2025-11-07

**Highlights:** This release dramatically simplifies onboarding with interactive CLI setup, comprehensive documentation relaunch, and intelligent model fallbacks, making Pipelex more accessible and resilient than ever.

### Added
 - Model Waterfalls: Define prioritized model lists in `base_deck.toml` (e.g., `smart_llm = ["gpt-4o", "claude-4.5-sonnet", "grok-3"]`). Pipelex automatically falls back to the next model if the preferred one is unavailable.
 - Advanced Routing Profiles: New capabilities in `routing_profiles.toml`: `fallback_order` (Global fallback sequence specifying which backends to try if a model isn't found) and `optional_routes` (Routes that activate only when their target backend is enabled)
 - New Models: Anthropic `claude-4.5-haiku` (Pipelex Inference, Anthropic, and Bedrock backends) and Azure OpenAI `o3`
 - Comprehensive Documentation Relaunch: Complete restructure under `/home/` with new "Get Started" guides for `pipelex build` and manual workflows, plus in-depth sections on Domains, Bundles, Concepts, and Pipe lifecycle.
 - Enhanced CLI: `pipelex init` now interactively guides backend selection and automatically configures routing profiles, including primary backend and fallback order. Added `pipelex init routing` focus.
 - Enhanced CLI: Improved error reporting across all commands (`build`, `validate`, `run`, `show`) with clear, actionable feedback for configuration errors, missing models, and invalid presets.
 - Enhanced CLI: `pipelex doctor` now validates model deck configuration.
 - New Routing Profiles: Full suite of `all_*` profiles (e.g., `all_openai`, `all_anthropic`, `all_google`) to route all requests to a single provider.

### Changed
 - BREAKING: for inline concept structures, the fields are now optional by default: the `required` property defaults to `false`. Explicitly set `required = true` to make fields mandatory, which we discourage as it increases risks of hallucinations.
 - LLM Presets Overhaul: Rationalized and renamed default presets in `base_deck.toml`. Single-model aliases replaced with waterfall aliases. Key renames: `llm_for_complex_reasoning` → `engineering-structured`, `llm_to_answer_hard_questions` → `llm_to_answer_questions`, `llm_to_write_questions` → `llm_for_writing_cheap`. Removed redundant older presets.
 - Stricter Configuration Validation: Pipelex validates model deck on startup and raises errors if presets reference unavailable models.

### Fixed
 - Local OpenAI-Compatible Endpoints: OpenAI plugin now handles empty API keys, enabling seamless integration with local servers like Ollama.

### Removed
 - Old Documentation Structure: Previous `/pages/` directory documentation removed in favor of new structure.

## [v0.14.3] - 2025-10-29

### Added
 - Image generation models via BlackBoxAI backend: `flux-pro`, `flux-pro/v1.1`, `flux-pro/v1.1-ultra` (Black Forest Labs), `fast-lightning-sdxl` (ByteDance), and `nano-banana` (Google). Implemented using new `openai_alt_img_gen` SDK worker with chat completion-style API.
 - Language model: `claude-4.5-sonnet` (Anthropic) via BlackBoxAI backend.
 - Routing profile: `all_blackboxai` profile routes all supported model requests to BlackBoxAI backend.

### Changed
 - Model aliases in `base_deck.toml`: `base-img-gen` → `flux-pro/v1.1-ultra`, `best-img-gen` → `nano-banana`, `llm_for_large_codebase` now includes `claude-4.5-sonnet`.
 - Configuration file: `BLACKBOX_RULES.md` renamed to `.blackboxrules`.

### Fixed
 - Image generation schema: `ImgGenJobParams.seed` field now explicitly defined with `default=None`.
 - CLI bundle validation: `pipelex validate` command now accepts bundle path (`.plx` file) which are in the package and already loaded and performs dry run on all pipes in the bundle.


## [v0.14.2] - 2025-10-29

### Chaged
- Improved pipe builder.

### Added
- CLI to generate inputs JSON.

## [v0.14.1] - 2025-10-27

### Added
- Tutorial GIF on the README.md file.

## [v0.14.0] - 2025-10-27

### Added
 - **`pipelex doctor` command**: Diagnoses and fixes common configuration issues including missing files, invalid telemetry settings, and unset environment variables for enabled backends.
 - **Interactive backend selection in `pipelex init`**: Multi-select menu for enabling/disabling inference backends (OpenAI, Anthropic, Amazon Bedrock, etc.).

 - **`pretty_print` methods**: Added to `PipeSpec`, `ConceptSpec`, and `Stuff` objects for readable debugging output.
 - **VS Code debug configuration**: "Debug run pipe" launch configuration for debugging pipeline executions.
 - **`display_name` attribute**: Added to all inference backends in `backends.toml` for better UI presentation.
 - **Documentation headers**: All default `.toml` configuration files now include headers with links to documentation and support channels.

### Changed
 - **`pipelex init` redesign**: Transformed into a unified, interactive setup wizard with rich terminal UI for configuration files, backend selection, and telemetry preferences. Telemetry is now configured here instead of via first-run prompt.
 - **`README.md` rewrite**: Complete overhaul featuring a simplified 5-step quick-start guide highlighting the `pipelex build` command.
 - **Documentation updates**: "Quick Start" guide renamed to "Writing Workflows" with simplified content. Python examples updated to use JSON input method, removing manual `Stuff` and `WorkingMemory` object creation boilerplate. Developer guides and AI assistant rules now recommend `pipelex validate` over `make validate`. Added instructions emphasizing `.venv` activation before running commands.
 - **Error handling improvements**: Pipelines now validate required inputs upfront and fail early with `PipeRunInputsError`. `pipelex run` prints full rich-formatted exception tracebacks on error.
 - **Default enabled backends**: Amazon Bedrock, Google AI, and Google Vertex AI are now enabled by default.
 - **Naming consistency**: "AWS Bedrock" renamed to "Amazon Bedrock" throughout codebase, configuration, and documentation.

### Fixed

- Some documentation links were broken.

### Added

- Added the `n8n` documentation page for the [n8n-nodes-pipelex](https://github.com/Pipelex/n8n-nodes-pipelex) package.
- Added optional telemetry system with first-run interactive prompt offering three modes: off (no data collected), anonymous (usage data without identification), and identified (usage data with user identification). Automatically respects `DO_NOT_TRACK` environment variable and redacts sensitive data (prompts, responses, file paths, URLs). Configuration stored in `.pipelex/telemetry.toml`.
- Added telemetry documentation: user-friendly setup guide and comprehensive configuration reference.

### Changed

- Updated the `PipelexClient` and changed the route of the API calls to `v1/pipeline/execute` and `v1/pipeline/start`.
- Changed the parameter `input_memory` to `inputs` in the documentaton.

## [v0.13.1] - 2025-10-22

### Changed

- Changed the `pydantic`dependency from `==2.10.6` to `>=2.10.6,<3.0.0` to avoid compatibility issues.

## [v0.13.0] - 2025-10-21

### Highlights - Simplifying pipeline execution and improving developer experience

This release focuses on making Pipelex more accessible and easier to use, with major improvements to the CLI, simplified syntax for multiplicity, and a complete documentation overhaul:

- **New CLI commands**: Run pipelines directly with `pipelex run`, generate Python runners with `pipelex build runner`, and inspect your AI backend configuration with `pipelex show backends`
- **Simplified pipeline inputs**: The new `inputs` parameter replaces `input_memory` and accepts strings, lists, or content objects directly - no more complex dictionary structures
- **Getting started faster**: Completely rewritten quick-start guide and new documentation sections help you go from installation to your first pipeline in minutes

### Added

- CLI command `pipelex run`: Top-level command to execute pipelines directly from the CLI. Can run pipes from the package or from any `.plx` bundle file, with options to provide inputs from a JSON file and save the output
- CLI command `pipelex build runner`: Generates Python script with imports and example input structures for any pipe
- CLI command `pipelex show backends`: Displays configured AI providers, their status, and active routing rules
- Model presets: Added task-oriented presets including `llm_to_write_questions`, `llm_to_code`, `llm_for_basic_vision`, `llm_for_visual_analysis`
- Documentation: Complete quick-start guide rewrite, new guides for "Understanding Multiplicity", "API Guide", "Executing Pipelines with Inputs", and updated README with video demo
- Migration guide: Updated guide at `pipelex/kit/migrations/migrate_0.11.0_0.12.x.md`

### Changed

- **Unified bracket notation for multiplicity**: Single items use `"Concept"`, variable lists use `"Concept[]"`, fixed-count lists use `"Concept[3]"`. Applies to both `inputs` and `output` fields in `.plx` files
- **Pipeline input format**: `input_memory` parameter renamed to `inputs`; now accepts strings, lists of strings, `StuffContent` objects, or explicit concept dictionaries instead of `CompactMemory`
- **Bundle `main_pipe` attribute**: Pipelex bundles (`.plx` files) now support a `main_pipe` attribute to designate the primary entry point of the bundle. Used by `pipelex run` and `pipelex build runner` commands to simplify execution
- **Model preset names**: `llm_to_reason` → `llm_for_complex_reasoning`, `base_ocr_mistral` → `extract_text_from_visuals`, `base_extract_pypdfium2` → `extract_text_from_pdf`, `base_img_gen` → `gen_image_basic`, `fast_img_gen` → `gen_image_fast`, `high_quality_img_gen` → `gen_image_high_quality`
- **Unified model parameter**: `PipeExtract` and `PipeImgGen` now use `model` parameter for consistency across all operator pipes
- **`PipeExtract` operator**: Output is now consistently validated to be the `Page` concept, simplifying its usage for document processing
- **CLI improvements**: `pipelex run` and `pipelex validate` now auto-detect pipe code vs `.plx` bundle files; `pipelex validate` promoted to top-level command with improved error reporting and syntax-highlighted code snippets
- **CLI reorganization**: Main command-line interface restructured for better usability with improved help texts and more logical command order
- **Python API**: `Pipelex.make()` now accepts dependency injection arguments directly
- **Python coding standards**: Updated internal coding standards to recommend declaring variables with a type but no default value to better leverage linters for bug detection
- **Default configuration**: Azure and AWS inference backends now disabled by default in template configuration

### Fixed

- Structure generation: Special characters (double quotes, backslashes) in concept field descriptions or default values no longer produce invalid Python code

### Removed

- Legacy multiplicity syntax: `nb_output`, `multiple_output` parameters, and complex input dictionary syntax with `multiplicity` field
- Pipe-specific model parameters: `ocr` parameter from `PipeExtract` and `img_gen` parameter from `PipeImgGen`
- `prompt_template_to_structure` and `system_prompt_to_structure` configurations at the pipe and domain level
- Project Name discovery from Configuration
- Temporary design document for the new inference backend system (feature now fully implemented and documented)

## [v0.12.0] - 2025-10-15

### Highlights - Moving fast and breaking things

- Added the new builder pipeline system for auto-generating Pipelex bundles from user briefs
  - it's a pipeline to generate pipelines, and it works!
  - the pipeline definitions are in `pipelex_libraries/pipelines/base_library/builder/`
  - removed the previous draft which was named `meta_pipeline.plx`

**Breaking changes... for good!**

We tried to group all the renamings we wanted to do which impact our language, so that you get one migration to apply and then we will be way more stable in the future releases.

This is all in the spirit of making Pipelex a declarative language, where you express what you want to do, and the system will figure out how to do it. So our focus inwas to make the Pipelex language easier to understand and use for non-technical users, and at the same time use more consistent and obvious words that developers are used to.

**💡 Pro tip:** To make migration easier, pass the [migration guide](https://github.com/Pipelex/pipelex/blob/main/pipelex/kit/migrations/migrate_0.11.0_0.12.0.md) to your favorite SWE agent (Cursor, Claude Code, github copilot, etc.) and let it handle the bulk of the changes!

- **Removed centralized `pipelex_libraries` folder system**
  - Pipelines are now auto-discovered from anywhere in your project—no special directory required
  - No config path parameters needed in `Pipelex.make()` or CLI commands (just call `Pipelex.make()`)
  - Custom functions require `@pipe_func()` decorator for auto-discovery
  - Structure classes auto-discovered (must inherit from `StructuredContent`)
  - Configuration stays at repository root in `.pipelex/` directory
  - See [migration guide](https://github.com/PipelexLab/pipelex/blob/main/pipelex/kit/migrations/migrate_0.11.0_0.12.0.md) for details on reorganizing your project structure

- General changes
  - renamed `definition` fields to `description` across all cases

- Renamed **PipeJinja2** to **PipeCompose**
  - the fact that our templating engine is Jinja2 is a technnical detail, not fundamental to the language, especially since we included a pre-processor enabling insertion of variables in prompts using `@variable` or `$variable`, in addition to the jinja2 syntax `{{ variable }}`
  - renamed `jinja2` field to `template` for the same reason
  - for more control, instead of providing a string for the `template` field, you can also use a nested `template` section with `template`, `category` and `templating_style` fields

- Renamed **PipeOCR** to **PipeExtract**
  - this is to account for various text extraction techniques from images and docs, including but not only OCR; e.g. we now have integrated the `pypdfium2` package which can extract text and images from PDF, when it's actually real text (not an image), and soon we'll add support for other document extraction models solutions
  - removed obligation to name your document input `ocr_input`, it can now be named whatever you want as long as it's a single input and it's either an `Image` or a `PDF` or some concept refining PDF or Image
  - renamed `ocr_page_contents_from_pdf` to `extract_page_contents_from_pdf`
  - renamed `ocr_page_contents_and_views_from_pdf` to `extract_page_contents_and_views_from_pdf`
  - introduced model settings and presets for extract models like we had for LLMs
  - renamed `ocr_model` to `model` for choice of model, preset, or explicit setting and introduced `base_ocr_mistral` as an alias to `mistral-ocr`

- **PipeLLM** field renames
  - image inputs must now be tagged in the prompt like all other inputs; you can just drop their names at the beginning or end of the prompt, or you can reference them in meaningful sentences to guide the Visual LLM, e.g. "Analyze the colors in $some_photo and the shapes in $some_painting." 
  - renamed `prompt_template` field to `prompt`
  - renamed `llm` field to `model`
  - renamed `llm_to_structure` field to `model_to_structure`

- **PipeImgGen** field renames
  - renamed `img_gen` field to `model` for choice of model, preset, or explicit setting
  - removed some technical settings such as `nb_steps` from the pipe attributes, instead you can set these as model settings or model presets
  - introduced model settings and presets for image generation models like we had for LLMs

- **PipeCondition** field renames
  - renamed `pipe_map` to `outcomes`
  - renamed `default_pipe_code` to `default_outcome` and it's now a required field, because we need to know what to do if the expression doesn't match any key in the outcomes map; if you don't know what to do in that case, then it's a failure and you can use the `fail` value

- **Configuration file changes** (`.pipelex/` directory)
  - Renamed parameter `llm_handle` to `model` across all LLM presets in deck files
  - Renamed parameter `img_gen_handle` to `model` across all image generation presets in deck files
  - Renamed parameter `ocr_handle` to `model` in extraction presets
  - Renamed `ocr` section to `extract` throughout configuration files
  - Renamed `ocr_config` to `extract_config` in `pipelex.toml`
  - Renamed `base_ocr_pypdfium2` to `base_extract_pypdfium2`
  - Renamed `is_auto_setup_preset_ocr` to `is_auto_setup_preset_extract`
  - Renamed `nb_ocr_pages` to `nb_extract_pages`
  - Updated pytest marker from 'ocr' to 'extract'

## [v0.11.0] - 2025-10-01

### Highlights

- **New pipe builder** pipeline to generate Pipes based on a brief in natural language: use the cli `pipelex build pipe "Your task"` to build the pipe.
- **New observer system:** inject your own class to observe and trace all details before and after each pipe run. We also provide a local observer that dumps the payloads to local JSONL files = new-line delilmited json, i.e. one json object per line.
- **Full refactoring of OCR and Image Generation** to use the same patterns as `LLM` workers and pipes.

### Added

 - Added `claude-4.5-sonnet` to the model deck.
 - Added a badge on the `README.md` to display the number of tests.
 - Added new test cases for environment variable functions
 - Added new documentation for `PipeFunc` on how to register functions.
 - Added `pipelex show models [BACKEND_NAME]` command to list available models from a specific backend.

### Changed 

 - Renamed `llm_deck` terminology to `model_deck` throughout codebase and documentation, now that it's also used for OCR and Image Generation models
 - Renamed `is_gha_testing` property to `is_ci_testing` in RuntimeManager
 - Refactored `all_env_vars_are_set()` function to only accept a list of keys, single string support now uses `is_env_var_set()`
 - Modified `any_env_var_is_placeholder()` to use new placeholder detection logic
 - Updated test environment setup to use dynamic placeholder generation instead of hardcoded values

### Fixed
 - Fixed logic error in `any_env_var_is_placeholder()` function - now correctly returns False when no placeholders are found

### Removed
 - Removed `get_rooted_path()` and `get_env_rooted_path()` utility functions which were not used
 - Removed hardcoded placeholder dictionary and `ENV_DUMMY_PLACEHOLDER_VALUE` constant in test setup
 - Removed function `run_pipe_code` in pipe router because it was not relevant (used mostly in tests)
 - Remove the use of `PipeCompose` in `PipeCondition`, to only use jinja2 directly, through the `ContentGenerator`
 - Remove the template libraries from the pipelex libraries.
 - Removed `claude-3.5-sonnet` and `claude-3.5-sonnet-v2` from the model deck.

## [v0.10.2] - 2025-09-18

## [v0.10.1] - 2025-09-17

### Changed

- Enabled all backends, still required to pass all unit tests.
- A few tweaks to the base model deck.

## [v0.10.0] - 2025-09-17

### Highlight: New Inference Backend Configuration System

We've completely redesigned how LLMs are configured and accessed in Pipelex, making it more flexible and easier to get started:

- **Get started in seconds** with [Pipelex Inference](configuration/config-technical/inference-backend-config.md): Use a single API key to access all major LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Mistral, and more)
- **Flexible backend configuration**: Configure multiple inference backends (Azure OpenAI, Amazon Bedrock, Vertex AI, etc.) through simple TOML files in `.pipelex/inference/`
- **Smart model routing**: Automatically route models to the right backend using [routing profiles](configuration/config-technical/inference-backend-config.md#routing-profiles) with pattern matching
- **User-friendly aliases**: Define shortcuts like `best-claude` → `claude-4.1-opus` with optional fallback chains
- **Cost-aware model specs**: Each model includes detailed pricing, capabilities, and constraints for better cost management

For complete details, see the [Inference Backend Configuration](configuration/config-technical/inference-backend-config.md) documentation.

### Added

- New inference backend configuration system in `.pipelex/inference/` directory
- Support for 10+ inference backends: OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure OpenAI, Amazon Bedrock, Mistral, Vertex AI, XAI, BlackboxAI, Perplexity, Ollama, and **Pipelex Inference**
- Model routing profiles with pattern matching (`*model*`, `model*`, `*model`)
- Model aliases with waterfall fallback chains
- Environment variable and secret substitution in TOML configs (`${VAR}` and `${secret:KEY}`)
- Comprehensive model specifications with detailed cost categories
- Unified plugin SDK registry for all backends
- CI environment detection with automatic placeholder API keys for testing
- Improved `pipelex init config` command to copy entire configuration template directory structure to `.pipelex/` with smart file handling (skips existing files, shows clear progress messages)
- Added `FuncRegistryUtils` to register functions in a pipelex folder that have a specific signature.
- Added `mistral-medium` and `mistral-medium-2508` to the Mistral backend configuration.
- Added `gemini-2.5-flash` to the VertexAI backend configuration.

- **LLM Settings Simplification**: Streamlined LLM choice system by removing complex `for_object_direct`, `for_object_list`, and `for_object_list_direct` options. LLM selection now uses a simpler fallback pattern: specific choice → text choice → overrides → defaults.
- **Image Model Updates**: Renamed `image_bytes` field to `base_64` in `PromptImageTypedBytes` for better consistency. Updated to use `CustomBaseModel` base class to benefit from bytes truncation when printing.

## [v0.4.10] - 2025-06-30

- Fixed a bad import statement

## [v0.4.9] - 2025-06-30

### Highlights

**Plugin System Refactoring** - Complete overhaul of the plugin architecture to support external LLM providers.

### Added

- **Class registry refactoring**: Updated kajson from 0.1.6 to 0.2.0, adapted to changes in [Kajson](https://github.com/Pipelex/kajson)'s class registry with new `ClassRegistryUtils` (better separation of concerns)
- **Dependency updates**:
  - Added pytest-mock to dev dependencies for improved unit testing

### Added
- **Coverage commands**: New Makefile targets for test coverage analysis:

    - **Material** for MkDocs theme, custom styling and navigation
    - Other plugins: meta-manager, glightbox
    - **GitHub Pages** deployment, mapped to [docs.pipelex.com](http://docs.pipelex.com)
    - Added GHA workflows for documentation deployment and validation
- **Added to docs:**
    - [**Manifesto**](https://docs.pipelex.com/manifesto/) explaining the Pipelex viewpoint
    - [**The Pipelex Paradigm**](https://docs.pipelex.com/pages/pipelex-paradigm-for-repeatable-ai-workflows/) explaining the fundamentals of Pipelex's solution
    - [**Cookbook examples](https://docs.pipelex.com/pages/cookbook-examples/)** presented and explained, commented code, some event with [mermaid](https://docs.pipelex.com/pages/cookbook-examples/invoice-extractor/) [flow](https://docs.pipelex.com/pages/cookbook-examples/extract-gantt/) [charts](https://docs.pipelex.com/pages/cookbook-examples/write-tweet/)
    - And plenty of details about **using Pipelex** and **developing for Pipelex,** from **structured generation** to PipeOperators (**LLM**, **Image generation**, **OCR**…) to PipeControllers (**Sequence**, **Parallel**, **Batch**, **Condition**…), workflow **optimization**, workflow static **validation** and dry run… there's still work to do, but we move fast!
- **Also a major update of Cursor rules**

### Tooling Improvements

- Pipeline tracking: restored **visual flowchart generation using Mermaid**
- Enhanced dry run configuration: added more granular control with `nb_list_items`, `nb_extract_pages`, and `image_urls`
- New feature flags: better control over pipeline tracking, activity tracking, and reporting
- Improved OCR configuration: handle image file type for Mistral-OCR, added `default_page_views_dpi` setting
- Enhanced LLM configuration: **better prompting for structured generation with automatic schema insertion** for two-step structuring: generate plain text and then structure via Json
- Better logging: Enhanced log truncation and display for large objects like image bytes (there are still cases to deal with)

### Refactor

**Concept system refactoring**

- Improved concept code factory with better domain handling, so you no longer need the `native` domain prefix for native domains, you can just call them by their names: `Text`, `Image`, `PDF`, `Page`, `Number`…
- Concept `refines` attribute can now be a string for single refined concepts (the most common case)

### Breaking Changes

- File structure changes: documentation moved from `doc/` to `docs/`
- Configuration changes: some configuration keys have been renamed or restructured
- `StuffFactory.make_stuff()` argument `concept_code` renamed to `concept_str` to explicitly support concepts without fully qualified domains (e.g., `Text` or `PDF` implicitly `native` )
- Some method signatures have been updated

### Tests

- **Added Concept refinement validation:** `TestConceptRefinesValidationFunction` and `TestConceptPydanticFieldValidation` ensure proper concept inheritance and field validation

## [v0.3.2] - 2025-06-13

- Improved automatic insertion of class structure from BaseModel into prompts, based on the PipeLLM's `output_concept`. New unit test included.
- The ReportingManager now reports costs for all pipeline IDs when no `pipeline_run_id` is specified.
- The `make_from_str` method from the `StuffFactory` class now uses `Text` context by default.

## [v0.3.1] - 2025-06-10

### Added
- New pytest marker `dry_runnable` for tests that can run without inference.
- Enhanced `make` targets with dry-run capabilities for improved test coverage:
  - `make test-xdist` (or `make t`): Runs all non-inference tests **plus inference tests** that support dry-runs - fast and resource-efficient
  - `make test-inference` (or `make ti`): Runs tests requiring actual inference, with actual inference (slow and costly)
- Parallel test execution using `pytest-xdist` (`-n auto`) enabled for:
  - GitHub Actions workflows
  - Codex test targets
  
### Changed
- Domain validation is now less restrictive in pipeline TOML: the `description` attribute is now `Optional`

## [v0.3.0] - 2025-06-09

### Highlights

- **Structured Input Specifications**: Pipe inputs are now defined as a dictionary mapping a required variable name to a concept code (`required_variable` -> `concept_code`). This replaces the previous single `input` field and allows for multiple, named inputs, making pipes more powerful and explicit. This is a **breaking change**.
- **Static Validation for Inference Pipes**: You can now catch configuration and input mistakes in your pipelines *before* running any operations. This static validation checks `PipeLLM`, `PipeExtract`, and `PipeImgGen`. Static validation for controller pipes (PipeSequence, PipeParallel…) will come in a future release.
    - Configure the behavior for different error types using the `static_validation_config` section in your settings. For each error type, choose to `raise`, `log`, or `ignore`.
- **Dry Run Mode for Zero-Cost Pipeline Validation**: A powerful dry-run mode allows you to test entire pipelines without making any actual inference calls. It's fast, costs nothing, works offline, and is perfect for linting and validating pipeline logic.
    - The new `dry_run_config` lets you control settings, like disabling Jinja2 rendering during a dry run.
    - This feature leverages `polyfactory` to generate mock Pydantic models for simulated outputs.
    - Error handling for bad inputs during `run_pipe` has been improved and is fully effective in dry-run mode.
    - One limitation: currently, dry running doesn't work when the pipeline uses a PipeCondition. This will be fixed in a future release.

### Added

- **`native.Anything` Concept**: A new flexible native concept that is compatible with any other concept, simplifying pipe definitions where input types can vary.
- Added dependency on `polyfactory` for mock Pydantic model generation in dry-run mode.

### Changed

- **Refactored Cognitive Workers**: The abstraction for `LLM`, `ImgGen`, and `Ocr` workers has been elegantly simplified. The old decorator-based approach (`..._job_func`) has been replaced with a more robust pattern: a public base method now handles pre- and post-execution logic while calling a private abstract method that each worker implements.
- The `b64_image_bytes` field in `PromptImageBytes` was renamed to `base_64` for better consistency.

### Fixed

- Resolved a logged error related to the pipe stack when using `PipeParallel`.
- The pipe tracker functionality has been restored. It no longer crashes when using nested object attributes (e.g., `my_object.attribute`) as pipe inputs.

### Tests

- A new pytest command-line option `--pipe-run-mode` has been added to switch between `live` and `dry` runs (default is `dry`). All pipe tests now respect this mode.
- Introduced the `pipelex_api` pytest marker for tests related to the Pipelex API client, separating them from general `inference` or `llm` tests.
- Added a `make test-pipelex-api` target (shorthand: `make ta`) to exclusively run these new API client tests.

### Removed

- The `llm_job_func.py` file and the associated decorators have been removed as part of the cognitive worker refactoring.

## [v0.2.14] - 2025-06-06

- Added a feature flag for the `ReportingManager` in the config: 
```bash
[pipelex]
[pipelex.feature_config]
is_reporting_enabled = true
```
- Moved the reporting config form the `cogt`config to the Pipelex config.

## [v0.2.13] - 2025-06-06

- Added Discord badge on the Readme. Join the community! -> https://go.pipelex.com/discord
- Added a client for the Pipelex API. Join the waitlist -> https://www.pipelex.com/signup
- Removed the `run_pipe_code` function. Replaced by `execute_pipeline` in `pipelex.pipeline.execute`.
- Added llm deck `llm_for_img_to_text`.
- Renamed `InferenceReportManager` to `ReportingManager`: It can report more than Inference cost. Renamed `InferenceReportDelegate` to `ReportingProtocol`.
- Added an injection of dependency for `ReportingManager`
- pipelex cli: fixed some bugs

## [v0.2.12] - 2025-06-03

- pipelex cli: Split `pipelex init` into 2 separate functions: `pipelex init-libraries` and `pipelex init-config`
- Fixed the inheritance config manager method
- Rename Mission to Pipeline
- Enable to start a pipeline and let in run in the background, getting it's run id, but not waiting for the output
- `Makefile`: avoid defaulting pytest to verbose. Setup target `make test-xdist` = Run unit tests with `xdist`, make it the default for shorthand `make t`. The old `make t` is now `make tp` (test-with-prints)
- Added `mistral-small-3.1` and `qwen3:8b`
- Fix template pre-processor: don't try and substitute a dollar numerical like $10 or @25
- Refactor with less "OpenAI" naming for non-openai stuff that just uses the OpenAI SDK

## [v0.2.11] - 2025-06-02

- HotFix for v0.2.10 👇 regarding the new pipelex/pipelex_init.toml`

## [v0.2.10] - 2025-06-02

### Highlights

**Python Support Expansion** - We're no longer tied to Python 3.11! Now supporting Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, and 3.13 with full CI coverage across all versions.

**Major Model Additions** - Claude 4 (Opus & Sonnet), Grok-3, and GPT-4 image generation are now in the house.

### Pipeline Base Library update
- **New pipe** - `ocr_page_contents_and_views_from_pdf` transferred from cookbook to base library (congrats on the promotion!). This pipe extracts text, linked images, **AND** page_view images (rendered pages) - it's very useful if you want to use Vision in follow-up pipes

### Added

- **Template preprocessor** - New `@?` token prefix for optional variable insertion - if a variable doesn't exist, we gracefully skip it instead of throwing exceptions
- **Claude 4 support** - Both Opus and Sonnet variants, available through Anthropic SDK (direct & Bedrock) plus Bedrock SDK. Includes specific max_tokens limit reduction to prevent timeout/streaming issues (temporary workaround)
- **Grok-3 family support** - Full support via OpenAI SDK for X.AI's latest models  
- **GPT-4 image generation** - New `gpt-image-1` model through OpenAI SDK, available via PipeImgGen. Currently saves local files (addressing in next release)
- **Gemini update** - Added latest `gemini-2.5-pro` to the lineup
- **Image generation enhancements** - Better quality controls, improved background handling options, auto-adapts to different models: Flux, SDXL and now gpt-image-1

### Refactored

- Moved subpackage `plugin` to the same level as `cogt` within **pipelex** for better visibility
- Major cleanup in the unit tests, hierarchy significantly flattened
- Strengthened error handling throughout inference flows and template preprocessing
- Added `make test-quiet` (shorthand `tq`) to Makefile to run tests without capturing outputs (i.e. without pytest `-s` option)
- Stopped using Fixtures for `pipe_router` and `content_generator`: we're now always getting the singleton from `pipelex.hub`


### Fixed

- **Perplexity integration** - Fixed breaking changes from recent updates

### Dependencies

- Added **pytest-xdist** to run unit tests in parallel on multiple CPUs. Not yet integrated into the Makefile, so run it manually with `pytest -n auto` (without inference) or `pytest -n auto -m "inference"` (inference only). 
- Swapped pytest-pretty for pytest-sugar - because readable test names > pretty tables
- Updated instructor to v1.8.3
- All dependencies tested against Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, and 3.13

### Tests

- TestTemplatePreprocessor
- TestImgGenByOpenAIGpt
- TestImageGeneration
- TestPipeImgGen
